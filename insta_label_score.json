Whether it\u2019s scientists in the lab, wildlife rangers on the ground, or people who spread awareness and support conservation causes, it takes each one of us playing our part to safeguard the world\u2019s dwindling wildlife. #elephants #elephantivory #elephantpoaching #notourstotrade", "commentCount": 806, "likeCount": 105927, "pubDate": "2022-10-21T16:00:15.000Z", "likedByViewer": "False", "isSidecar": "False", "type": "Photo", "caption": "Photo by National Geographic on October 21, 2022.

My partner and I live between Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia, and three years ago we adopted Goose from a Virginia shelter. They had rented out an empty storefront and filled it with adorable, adoptable puppies, all of which thankfully found loving homes. One of those pups was a chubby little three-month-old hound mix with dirt on his nose, spots on his ears, and soulful eyes. He slept on my lap the whole car ride home. He remained a sleepy, snuggly puppy for about 24 more hours, and then it was go time! Goose loves action, whatever it may be\u2014playing with other dogs, fetch, running. Most of all, he loves it when all of these things can happen in water. Goose loves to swim, but he wasn\u2019t always so comfortable in water. We first tried to teach him to swim in a pool, but he couldn't figure out the stairs. We had to carry him in. Then he couldn\u2019t get enough. Lakes, streams, even the ocean\u2014Goose goes right in! Watching him swim still makes me feel super proud and inspires me to be brave and overcome my own fears. // Dogs make the world a better place.

Jaguars have rebounded in the Brazilian Pantanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past, many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle, but jaguars may be worth far more alive than dead. In a paper published by the journal Global Ecology and Conservation, @pantheracats biologist Fernando Tortato found that a cow in the Pantanal is worth $2,000 in its lifetime, but a jaguar in this area brings in $108,000 each year in ecotourism income.\n\nThe Pantanal is a shining example of big-cat and other wildlife tourism as one of the most profitable land-use types on Earth. This is all the more important in world so fixated on beef production and agriculture that clear forests and release carbon into the atmosphere. Local people need to benefit from living with predators, not killing them and selling their parts. A sustainable future includes people living with wildlife and an intact healthy ecosystem.

Text by Rebecca Sanchez @rbeckslee.\n\nIn our article on \u201ckeepers of community\u201d in the September issue of National Geographic magazine, read about Sonia Ventura. She is part of the glue that holds her community of Vieques, Puerto Rico, together. \n\nBefore her death at the age of 79 late last year, Sonia Ventura evoked the aura of a spirited youth. Even seeing her at a distance, standing beneath the beating sun on hot gravel and surrounded by roosters, the first thing you noticed was the way her hands danced. She spoke fast and without breaks, gesturing wildly as she moved in conversation, effortlessly, between God and gossip. She had stories about everyone. \n\nBorn on the small island of Vieques off Puerto Rico\u2019s eastern coast, which Viequenses call \u201cthe colony of a colony,\u201d she was raised in New York before returning to her roots in 2003. There, she found her people in a struggle that was bad enough before the damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the days of COVID-19. \n\nMany of the older residents were in dire need of care, but they refused to leave.

He\u2019s broken multiple world records in paragliding, made dozens of first descents on rivers, and scaled some of the most difficult winter climbs on the planet.\n\nI first met Gadd close to 20 years ago, when he was already one of the top climbers in the world (and a top paraglider). He and his friends were climbing furiously in the Canadian Rockies, redefining the future of mixed (rock and ice) climbing at that time. He continues to push the sport. In his episode of \"Edge of the Unknown,\" Gadd faces the ultimate challenge of his career: attempting a first ascent of Helmcken Falls, where he realized the only way to find the edge is to go over it. The 430-foot frozen waterfall, in British Columbia, is known as one of the hardest mixed climbs on Earth, and Gadd wanted to be the first to climb it. Dangling from ice daggers below a giant overhanging wall, Gadd grapples with the risks and rewards of this esoteric sport. He also reveals how he manages family with the ambition to do what no one else has been able to do. \n\nTune in for the episode \u201cWill Power,\u201d on Tuesday, September 13, at 10:30/9:30c.

I imagined the picture: they would stretch, roll, and nuzzle each other for a bit, and then perhaps stand to send out contact roars to the females.\n\nAs I arrived, the sky began to swell, the clouds a welcome respite from the afternoon heat. I parked for a view of the mound, with composition in mind. I watched as the aerial masterpiece continued. But the lions did not move. Rays of sun exploded through billowing cracks. The lions rolled over. The sun found a circular hole in the sky cover, and the termite mound exploded in a beam of gold. The lions did not move. I would wait until they got up. I was ready with a wide-angle lens. They never got up. \n\nThe sun met the horizon. The afterglow continued into a crescendo. The lions lay flat. Perhaps they knew what I'd come for and laughed at my confidence, or they wanted to test my resolve. Or, just maybe, they wanted me to look beyond them and remember the larger picture we are all a part of. #lions #bigcats #wildlife #lionking", "commentCount": 669, "likeCount": 123819, "pubDate": "2022-09-03T16:00:11.000Z", "likedByViewer": "False", "isSidecar": "False", "type": "Photo", "caption": "Photo by National Geographic on September 03, 2022.

Indeed, sightings are epic. The land is dusty, hot, and brown. The tall grasses are gone. And since the animals must come to drink, a water hole is a perfect place to be positioned at.\n\nBut there is another magical time for an African safari, one that many never consider. Rainy season not only is a less expensive time to visit but also offers a completely different landscape\u2014one of technicolor green backgrounds, flowers, and golden light. Sure, dense foliage and thick grasses sometimes pose a bit of a challenge spotting predators. But when you do find them, the images to be made are of a completely different level of awesome.\n\nI had no trouble finding furries on this trip to Botswana. And I didn\u2019t just find the predators\u2014I found their baby versions. Two different families of leopard cubs and their mothers, and two different families of lion cubs and lionesses, graced the days. Botswana unveiled scene after scene of photographic opportunity, from African wild dogs to big cats to hippos, elephants, and rhinos. I think the rainy season is my new favorite time to visit. \n\nFor more stories of animals, follow me @kaigner. #babyanimals #bigcats #babies #lioncubs #lions #africa #travel #botswana", "commentCount": 1231, "likeCount": 277264, "pubDate": "2022-08-20T21:00:11.000Z", "likedByViewer": "False", "isSidecar": "False", "type": "Photo", "caption": "Photo by National Geographic on August 20, 2022.

Preserving huge tracts of forest, wetlands, and jungle for tigers has a ripple effect for the globe. Those forests pull carbon from the atmosphere and slow climate change. Forests provide oxygen and purify the rivers running through them, a freshwater supply that feeds our faucets. In saving tigers, we preserve the spectrum of life that shares their realm\u2014ecosystems that have been fine-tuned over millennia.\n\nThese tigers are mostly from India's Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, except for the final image which was taken in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh, the world\u2019s largest wetland, now threatened by rising sea levels. #worldtigerday #tigers", "commentCount": 1719, "likeCount": 389350, "pubDate": "2022-07-29T21:25:00.000Z", "likedByViewer": "False", "isSidecar": "True", "type": "Photo", "caption": "", "profileUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/natgeo", "username": "natgeo", "imgUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CgnHYpVOQgI/media/?size=l", "postId": 2.893313761e+24, "timestamp": 1668011869177, "query": "https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/", "videoUrl": "", "viewCount": "", "fullName": "National Geographic", "playCount": "", "videoDuration": "", "taggedFullName1": "", "taggedUsername1": "", "taggedFullName2": "", "taggedUsername2": "", "taggedFullName3": "", "taggedUsername3": "", "taggedFullName4": "", "taggedUsername4": "", "labels": ["Bengal tiger", "Siberian tiger", "Plant", "Tiger", "Felidae", "Carnivore", "Natural environment", "Organism", "Vegetation", "Big cats"], "score": [0.9617637395858765, 0.9556093215942383, 0.9509319067001343, 0.9379410743713379, 0.9153713583946228, 0.8910866379737854, 0.8909077048301697, 0.8597248196601868, 0.8526666760444641, 0.8451573848724365]}, {"postUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CgnHYpVOQgI/", "description": "Photos by @stevewinterphoto | Today is Global Tiger Day!

I've photographed snakes on all continents where they're found, producing two stories for @natgeo in the process. It's tough to single out a favorite species, but the Jameson's mamba, photographed in the rainforest of Cameroon, is a strong contender. Its venom is lethal; unlike other venomous snakes that specialize in just one kind of venom, the Jameson's mamba delivers a particularly nasty cocktail: hemotoxins, cardiotoxins, fasciculins, as well as myotoxic substances. The lethal characteristics of snake venom are what make it so valuable; scientists study the genetic and molecular makeup by collecting venom and DNA samples.

As a result, predators have also largely disappeared. But the return of vegetation and grazing mammals will, it\u2019s hoped, culminate in the reintroduction of the critically endangered Arabian leopard, once the top predator in this vast and mysterious land. Overall, the aim is to restore Saudi\u2019s landscapes to their natural state. Engagement with local communities is vital if this is to succeed.

The male giraffe (left) has a snare around his neck. Snares are traps, most often made of wire, set by poachers to catch animals for the illegal bushmeat trade. While many animals caught in snares are consumed for food, others will be left to rot or be so severely wounded that they cannot feed or hunt, drying as a result.\n\nAcross Africa, giraffe populations dropped nearly 40 percent in three decades, a decline thought to be linked to habitat loss and fragmentation as well as poaching, including animals killed by snares. But  giraffe numbers may be rebounding. An analysis of survey data from across the continent suggests the total giraffe population is now around 117,000, approximately 20 percent higher than in 2015, when the last major survey was published. The increase can be attributed to population growth in some areas but also to more accurate census methods.

I had no cell phone and no support crew. Just me, my dog, Cosmo, a camera, and a wagon filled with supplies. It was the project that started my photography career.\n\nOn the walk, I went to prom, won second place in a hog-calling contest, ran out of water in the desert, slept in an open jail cell, got blisters three layers deep, almost got hit by more trucks than I can count, loitered a lot, and got really good at playing a children\u2019s electric guitar.\n\nThe first thousand miles were marked by extreme physical pain, as I whittled my untrained body and mind into shape. I kept thinking that the place I needed to be was somewhere other than the present moment, step, or conversation. Over time, this desire to be anywhere but in the present broke away.\n\nThe middle 1,500 miles was a space of opening like I\u2019ve never experienced in my life\u2014a time marked by letting go of everything. The pain went away, and all the doors seemed to open as I walked ten 30-mile days in a row out of Santa Fe, feeling unstoppable on the road.\n\nWith 900 miles left, I stopped in Bloomington, Indiana, and rested for three days. I sat down with a map and charted what I believed would be the end of the walk. When I saw that end on the map, it felt like it was over. I already knew I could do it; I\u2019d already done it. That last 900 miles started to hurt again as I looked too far ahead.

That\u2019s right\u2014more than half of the oxygen you breathe comes from marine plants, such as phytoplankton and seaweed, that engage in photosynthesis.

Think about that for a moment. It means at least every second breath each one of us takes comes from our beautiful oceans. Today, take a deep breath and feel that connection.

Both women carry medicinal plants, used throughout the region for healing. During the pandemic, midwives in Chiapas have been on the birthing front lines, especially in remote areas, despite receiving little support from local health-care authorities.

Little owls feed primarily on insects like beetles and grasshoppers as well as bigger prey such as rodents, reptiles, and amphibians. They're one of the best allies for farmers, helping to keep pests under control. Unfortunately the use of insecticides has decimated the populations of many species, including little owls. The lack of prey and nesting sites are other threats, mainly due to the rise of industrialized agriculture.
