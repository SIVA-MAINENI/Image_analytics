    "description": "Photo by Corey Arnold @arni_coraldo | San Francisco was the focus of the raccoon portion of my article on urban wildlife, but on most nights during my quest, a coyote seemed to show up and steal the show. This coyote is letting out a defensive warning—a howl toward the presence of a pre-dawn dog walker nearby. Coyotes often feast on rodents and other natural foods found in parks, empty lots, and overgrown green spaces. But there are conflicting opinions about whether coyotes should be allowed to populate dense urban spaces. Pets such as cats and small dogs have increasingly been targeted as the coyotes expand across the San Francisco Bay Area. Check out the story by writer @christinedellamore and me in the July issue or in the link in bio. #urbanwildlife #coyote #howl #carnivore",

The females lay two eggs. When they hatch, she must choose between the stronger of her two offspring to raise. The weaker one is left to fend for itself, most often succumbing to the difficulties of survival. I'm currently traveling the world by sailboat with my family. Follow me for more scenes of my seafaring adventures.",

The Maasai people are an Indigenous ethnic group in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania who maintain their way of life, despite government programs encouraging them to give up their seminomadic lifestyle. The Maasai’s traditional survival skills—such as the ability to produce food in dry, arid lands—offer strategies for adapting to environments altered by climate change, an Oxford study has found.

The women in Afghanistan are the main source of my inspiration. I keep praying for them, and it is for them that I run.”\n\n(1) Zahra goes for a short trail run near her college’s campus in New Hampshire in preparation for last year’s New York City Marathon.

The ancient Egyptian relic, used to store the guts of the deceased, dates back to 600 B.C. When the pandemic kept most foreign archaeologists at home, Waziri hired locals to carry on the work and in doing so greatly increased the number of digs overseen by Egyptians.",

    "description": "Photo by @estherhorvath | My portrait series on women in Arctic science focuses on climate researchers and explorers who work in one of the world’s most challenging environments: Ny-Ålesund, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago—the northernmost community in the world that's home to a diverse group of scientists. I capture my subjects in the magical atmosphere of a place connected to their work—and in this case, their dreams. \n\nKatie Sipes, a postdoctoral researcher, dressed as her favorite movie character, Frozen's Elsa. She took this costume with her on a permafrost expedition because she had dreamed of somehow finding an occasion to wear it in the far reaches of Norway, which inspired the film's fictional kingdom. With this portrait, she now had the chance. Sipes identifies with the character's call to forge her own path, and the idea, she says, that “strong females don’t need a prince.”\n\nHer mission is to study Arctic ecosystems and the organisms that rely on them, she says, \"allowing humans to better understand the magnitude and incredible diversity that lives on our own planet.\" And knowing this extreme environment better might prime us to better understand other planets, she adds. She's drawn by a sense of urgency: \"This endangered ecosystem is on the cusp of being lost forever. The purity of the Arctic amplifies the desire to preserve and study all of its hidden secrets that might change our world.” Follow me @estherhorvath for more polar science stories.",

Millipedes are detrivores, which means that they feed on dead and decaying organic matter within their habitat. Once food is digested, these critters leave their nutrient-rich droppings all along the forest floor, creating new soil that helps plant life and other species that rely on the rainforest to thrive. Video taken @lincolnchildrenszoo. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark follow me, @joelsartore. #millipede #giant #insectphotography #insect #animals #animal #legs #gardener #PhotoArk",

What remains of suitable lion habitat is under threat from human encroachment, climate change, and degradation. Without wilderness, lion numbers—and the numbers of so many other species—will continue to diminish. A new assessment by the World Wildlife Fund warns that across the globe, populations of vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish) have declined by 69% on average since 1970, with habitat destruction as a leading cause in all regions. To stem and reverse these losses, we need to focus our will and energy on preserving and protecting habitats—in short, we need to make room for wildlife. \n#lions #lionconservation #bigcatconservation #lioncubs",

    "description": "Photos by @bertiegregory | Meet one of the most important animals on Earth: Antarctic krill. These tiny shrimplike crustaceans swarm in the millions and form the basis of the Antarctic food chain. Pretty much every predator in Antarctica eats krill: penguins, whales, albatrosses, fish, even leopard seals. A 2009 study estimated that Antarctica krill weigh between 300 and 500 million metric tons, making their biomass the largest of any multicellular wild-animal species on the planet. Filmed for “Epic Adventures With Bertie Gregory,” now streaming on @disneyplus. #EpicAdventures #EpicAdventuresWithBertieBregory",

    "description": "Photos by @alessandro.cinque | Near Ausangate, a mountain in the Peruvian Andes, artisan Francisca Huamani, 72, makes alpaca fiber handicrafts. (The light source is from an LED my assistant is holding.) In recent years, alpaca breeding has declined significantly as climate change alters weather patterns, with abrupt shifts in precipitation and ice melting as glaciers retreat. The effects include an increased mortality in newborn alpaca and shrinking grasslands where herds feed. The consequences are devastating the already marginalized and impoverished Andean communities, which struggle to adapt. The third photo shows Huamani's son inside the house, with the mountain behind him. While he remains, for me the photo represents the migration of many young people to cities, leaving this sadly unprofitable tradition behind.

    "description": "Photo by @joelsartore | Meet Bin, an endangered northern yellow-cheeked gibbon, photographed @eprc.vietnam. Gibbons like Bin are exclusively arboreal, meaning they spend almost all their time in trees, trying to avoid touching their feet to the ground. While this might seem impossible, it's actually quite easy for gibbons thanks to their extra-long arms. This species uses those lanky forelimbs for brachiation—a form of movement in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark follow me @joelsartore. #gibbon #primate #animal #mammal #cheeks #photography #animalphotography #wildlifephotography #studioportrait #PhotoArk",

(The subject herself isn't a singer but represents the idea.)\n\nIt was part of a project I call Listen, photographed in 2010-2011, which focused on Iran's women singers—who are not allowed to perform solo or produce their own CDs due to Islamic regulations in effect since the 1979 revolution.\n\nFor the other photos I made in the series, I captured six individual professional singers, performing as if they were in front of a large audience—in reality it was in a small private studio in downtown Tehran. Then I made a dream CD cover for each of the women, my own interpretation of the society I live in and experience. #Iran",

    "description": "Video by @bertiegregory | This was one of the calmer days at sea as we looked for whales off the coast of Elephant Island, in Antarctica. In order to launch drones and our little dive boat, we needed a maximum of 25 knots of wind—and ideally much lower speeds. The weather changed so quickly, and we were searching for whales over such a large area that we decided to simply adopt the \"be in it to win it\" approach. If the forecast showed even the tiniest window of less than 25 knots, we would smash out into the surf to make sure we’d be in the \"whale area\" during that time. Filmed for Epic Adventures, now streaming on @disneyplus. #EpicAdventures #EpicAdventuresWithBertieGregory",

As it cools, the sulfur hardens into yellow crystal blocks that are sorted by miners—who have only face cloths to protect themselves from the noxious fumes. Three times a day they carry loads of sulfur, weighing up to 175 lbs (80 kg), to the top of the crater. This has to be one of the world’s toughest jobs—the fumes made us gag and our eyes water whenever the wind blew them in our direction. #ijenvolcano #Indonesia #maritimesilkroad #Zhenghe",

Most followers know me for my images of the night sky, but this post is my tribute to millions of women in Iran who fight for freedom. Mahsa Amini, 22, was visiting family in Tehran in mid-September when she was arrested for an \"improper hijab\" (head covering) while riding inside her brother's car. She died several days later, sparking national protests. Amini had suffered multiple blows to the head, according to London-based broadcaster Iran International. \n\nI was born in Iran in 1978 and lived there for 33 years. During that time, I witnessed women living in daily fear of the hijab police. What is less known to the outside world is that Iranian society appears to be becoming more secular, though strict hijab enforcement is still a focus of the country's leaders. Meanwhile protests continue across the country despite severe crackdowns.",

Roughly twice a year, the mobile clinic travels the country’s Baikal–Amur Magistral railway line, which crosses Siberia to the Russian Far East for more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), and stops at villages along the way to provide medical care to residents. Named after Matvei Yakovlevich Mudrov, a 19th-century physician who helped establish clinical practice in Russia, the train is operated by the state-owned Russian Railways and employs around 15 doctors who offer specialized services, including x-ray, ultrasound, neurology, and ophthalmology. For many communities along the rail line, the Matvei Mudrov represents a rare connection to the rest of the country.

My Thanksgiving plans had been canceled, and I decided to go for a two-hour drive. “Just to see,” I told myself. When I walked in the room, she beelined toward me like we knew each other. Kali came home that night. What I didn’t know was that she’d spent the first year of her life in a crate in shelters, had never had a family, couldn’t walk on a leash, was scared of everything, and didn’t for one second consider herself a dog. The lost soul soon showed her true spirit in the big city, where she quickly adapted. She was smart and eager. We learned about each other—and became inseparable. In time, Kali overcame her fear of life, learned to trust, and blossomed. She soon walked the streets as if she owned them, accompanying me to restaurants, bars, and any place that would let her in. She lived for our morning runs in the forest. She’s my sidekick and best friend. The bond between us runs deep. Today, Kali comes everywhere—rock climbing, hiking, camping, road trips, and the supermarket. She is a master adventurer, always up for anything, and always up for a fantastic view at the edge of the Chama River in New Mexico. Shelter dogs are special beings. Never pass one up—they are forever grateful, and you’ll have a forever friend. // In honor of National Make A Dog’s Day today, help us celebrate our furry friends by participating in the @natgeoyourshot #MakeADogsDay Challenge! Head to the pinned post on @natgeoyourshot to learn more. // Subaru and its retailers are proud to celebrate their 4th annual National #MakeADogsDay on Oct. 22.",

    "description": "Photo by @joelsartore | Found on every continent except Antarctica and South America, moles like this eastern mole @newildliferehab in Nebraska are often seen as garden pests because of their intricate underground tunnel systems. While their tunneling behavior may label moles as a backyard nuisance, they actually play a beneficial role in soil management and controlling the population of undesirable grubs and insects. By moving earth, moles facilitate better aeration of the soil and enable organic matter to travel deeper. Their tunneling also allows subsoil material to be moved closer to the surface, where nutrients may be more available to plant roots. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark follow me, @joelsartore.  #mole #easternmole #animal #underground #wildlife #photography #PhotoArk",

Tiger numbers are increasing in South Asia, not only in India but in Nepal and Bhutan as well. Populations are considered stable in the Russian Far East and in areas along the Russia-China border.

    "description": "Photo by Mattias A. Klum @mattiasklumofficial | A Galápagos land iguana has a favorite spiny meal on Isabela Island. Since freshwater is scarce on the Galápagos Islands, this gorgeous lizard obtains most of its moisture from the prickly pear that makes up a large proportion of its diet. It’s estimated that between 5,500 and 9,500 land iguanas are found in the Galápagos. On Santiago Island, when it was previously called King James Island, they were so abundant that naturalist Charles Darwin had remarked, “When we were left at James, we could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to pitch our single tent.” In the years since, entire populations (including all the animals on Santiago Island) have been wiped out by introduced feral animals, such as goats, cats, and pigs.

    "description": "Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | As I sit on yet another flight, my mind wanders. The Earth slowly moves below me, cities pass by, and finally the landscape opens up. Somehow, I feel a little less stressed by my journey. Raising awareness of the plight of the planet's biodiversity has become a passion, and when I join with other like-minded individuals I think, and hope, that it can truly make a difference. \n\nIt’s hard to believe that it was only in 2014—when I was based in Kenya and covering the worst poaching crisis in generations—that the last confirmed sighting of an Arabian leopard occurred in the wild in Saudi Arabia. The animal was sadly later found dead, poisoned by a camel herder. In the years since, an inspiring international effort has begun to preserve, breed, and reintroduce this extraordinary apex predator into the Arabian Peninsula—this one seen in Taif, Saudi Arabia.

    "description": "Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | As I sit on yet another flight, my mind wanders. The Earth slowly moves below me, cities pass by, and finally the landscape opens up. Somehow, I feel a little less stressed by my journey. Raising awareness of the plight of the planet's biodiversity has become a passion, and when I join with other like-minded individuals I think, and hope, that it can truly make a difference. \n\nIt’s hard to believe that it was only in 2014—when I was based in Kenya and covering the worst poaching crisis in generations—that the last confirmed sighting of an Arabian leopard occurred in the wild in Saudi Arabia. The animal was sadly later found dead, poisoned by a camel herder. In the years since, an inspiring international effort has begun to preserve, breed, and reintroduce this extraordinary apex predator into the Arabian Peninsula—this one seen in Taif, Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, when it has previously encountered humans and their livestock, the result has inevitably been fatal. So now, alongside rewilding, we need to educate and engage with the communities who will share their land with the leopard.

Their diets may vary by location but mostly consist of fish and krill. They're capable of diving to depths of up to 175 meters (575 ft), though they usually feed within the first 70 meters (230 ft)—an incredibly impressive feat. Once they enter the ocean, they also face predators such as leopard seals and killer whales. Fortunately, they're efficient swimmers, and they'll swim in groups to reduce their own chances of becoming a meal. \n#Wildlife #Penguin #Antarctica #Ocean #AdéliePenguin",

    "description": "Photo by @katieorlinsky // This is my three-year-old dog Goose chasing sticks in the Red Hook Channel, New York. My partner and I live between Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia, and three years ago we adopted Goose from a Virginia shelter. They had rented out an empty storefront and filled it with adorable, adoptable puppies, all of which thankfully found loving homes. One of those pups was a chubby little three-month-old hound mix with dirt on his nose, spots on his ears, and soulful eyes. He slept on my lap the whole car ride home. He remained a sleepy, snuggly puppy for about 24 more hours, and then it was go time! Goose loves action, whatever it may be—playing with other dogs, fetch, running. Most of all, he loves it when all of these things can happen in water. Goose loves to swim, but he wasn’t always so comfortable in water. We first tried to teach him to swim in a pool, but he couldn't figure out the stairs. We had to carry him in. Then he couldn’t get enough. Lakes, streams, even the ocean—Goose goes right in! Watching him swim still makes me feel super proud and inspires me to be brave and overcome my own fears. // Dogs make the world a better place.

Most followers know me for my pictures of the night sky, but I can’t find beauty in the stars when my motherland is in pain. I was born in Iran in 1978 and lived there for 33 years. \nFor me, this image is symbolic. In Iran the internet has been shut down to stop social media coverage of the current nationwide uprising. The unrest was triggered by 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing a proper head covering, in line with the country’s Islamic law. An estimated 80% of Iran’s 86 million people are usually connected to the web and active on social media despite strong internet censorship. International reporters are not allowed in Iran; the major news media rely on public phone footage. Iranian expatriates are trying to support the protesters by sharing their stories and organizing events worldwide.",

The reserve was founded in 1997 in order to protect a rare bird, Grallaria ridgelyi, an endangered antpitta. But the place is home to other threatened species like the Tapichalaca torrenter frog, the mountain tapir, and the Andean bear.  It's also one of the most diverse hot spots in the Andes for orchid species. Many are new to science and also under pressure from an illegal trade.

    "description": "Photo by @estherhorvath | How do people on polar expeditions spend their free time and evenings far away from civilization, where there is no mobile phone connection, no TV, no internet, and no radio? On expeditions you have to solve everything yourself, and that was also the case for MOSAiC, in the central Arctic Ocean. One evening, boatswain Sebastian Brück opened a pop-up barbershop in the metal workstation of our ship, Polarstern, to get a much needed haircut. Here, Captain Stefan Schwarze gets his turn after two months on board. Please follow @estherhorvath and @awiexpedition for further polar stories.",

Here, Irene is getting her baby examined at a local hospital in North Pokot Sub-county, Kenya. \n\nReports of gender-based violence in Kenya increased by 92% between January and June 2020, compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth, particularly among FGM (female genital mutilation) survivors, are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, and the risk of maternal mortality is five times higher for girls under 15 years of age, according to the  WHO. \n\nThis image was made possible thanks to a National Geographic Society grant supporting my work on inequality for girls, which focuses on the harmful effects of worsening global poverty and climate change on this most vulnerable population. #tooyoungtowed #endchildmarriage #girls #Internationaldayofthegirl",

To get around in this environment, you must either be able to fly or swim. In the summertime, the mires are full of nutrients and a refuge for hundreds of species of birds that nest here. Out on the open mire, whooper swans build large nests in dense tufts of grass or sedge, called tussocks. Even though you can see the nests from afar, they are completely safe. Neither foxes nor other predators can reach them in this waterlogged environment.

But only one in five girls makes it to the eighth year. This high drop-out rate is a result of early marriage, female genital cutting, poverty, and other factors. Each extra year of schooling, however, brings higher wages and a lower infant mortality rate.

Researchers have found that the close bonds these orphans forge with one another help defray the stress of being separated from their mothers and herds. Young orphaned elephants living with peers or other family members, such as aunts, cousins, or siblings, had stress hormone levels comparable to young elephants living with their mothers. To learn more, read the article “For orphaned elephants, friends may be key to stress relief,” and follow @amivitale. #elephants #conservation #kenya #africa #babyanimals",

In the pockets of sub-Saharan Africa where they still maintain strongholds, their future is increasingly uncertain. Protecting and expanding space for lions to roam safely has been at the heart of my conservation work for decades.

While working on a National Geographic story about Silicon Valley culture, I spent time at Startup Embassy, photographing their (now former) location at a house in Palo Alto. Hopeful guests, mostly international start-up founders, applied to live and work at the house for up to a few months. They shared living and work spaces and built friendships and collaborations. The house often hosted events and parties for the local start-up community in the garage. The concept behind such co-living communities is that being surrounded by a group of other entrepreneurs would help the housemates brainstorm, network, and launch themselves and their companies in Silicon Valley. For more photographs of people. and places, follow along @laurakmorton.",

This remote isle in the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary is an important resting place—known as a haul-out—for male Pacific walruses, which gather by the thousands every summer to feed and recuperate after mating season. The textured nodules on male walruses’ skin, called bosses, become more pronounced as the animals age.\n\nFollow me @acacia.johnson for more from Alaska and beyond. #walrus #alaska #wildlife #walrusislands",

    "description": "Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Happy World Animal Day! Jaguars have rebounded in the Brazilian Pantanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past, many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle, but jaguars may be worth far more alive than dead. In a paper published by the journal Global Ecology and Conservation, @pantheracats biologist Fernando Tortato found that a cow in the Pantanal is worth $2,000 in its lifetime, but a jaguar in this area brings in $108,000 each year in ecotourism income.\n\nThe Pantanal is a shining example of big-cat and other wildlife tourism as one of the most profitable land-use types on Earth. This is all the more important in world so fixated on beef production and agriculture that clear forests and release carbon into the atmosphere. Local people need to benefit from living with predators, not killing them and selling their parts. A sustainable future includes people living with wildlife and an intact healthy ecosystem. Think of all the people in an area that work in ecotourism—running the lodges, driving the boats, guiding the tourists—and the families their income supports. If you save the top predator in any ecosystem, you save everything under it.\n\nCheck out National Geographic’s campaign for nature at the link in bio, which advocates for the protection of 30% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface by 2030, and follow me @stevewinterphoto for more shots of big cats. #jaguar #jaguars #coexistence #wildlifephotography #beauty #pantanal #brazil #wilderness #wild #conservation #jungle #forest",

More than 60,000 currently live in the city, the biggest such diaspora in the United States, and many still reside in the few blocks of East Seventh Street and Second Avenue. Many original businesses and organizations remain open, including the iconic restaurant Veselka, established in 1954, and St. George Ukrainian Catholic Church, which holds mass every Sunday.

Hyenas have an extremely powerful bite force, allowing them to crunch through thick bones to get to the marrow within—why their poop is often white. Despite their reputation as scavengers, they are also efficient hunters, working alone to run down prey or together as a pack. The big cats that hyenas share the plains with—the lions, leopards, and cheetahs—rely on ambush and short bursts of speed. Hyenas use stamina to bring down prey, chasing animals down until they tire.",

They can be thousands of years old. For more, see the October issue of National Geographic magazine.",

I later visited the Animal Nutrition Center where a team of 25 prepares portions for all the animals, which amounts to about 10,000 pounds of food each day. Bringing the experience full circle, I caught a ride to the savanna, where I watched the animals being fed.

Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park has nearly 30 acres that grow 17 tree and shrub varieties, browse that is harvested daily. I later visited the Animal Nutrition Center where a team of 25 prepares portions for all the animals, which amounts to about 10,000 pounds of food each day. Bringing the experience full circle, I caught a ride to the savanna, where I watched the animals being fed.

Vendors from all over the country arrive around sunrise to be the first to sell freshly harvested katydids, which are still alive and stored in large bags. Occasionally katydids escape from the bag, but then they face another challenge: these birds of prey, which also have their eyes on a fresh katydid snack.

One of the earliest theories for why giraffes are so tall is that being able to reach the highest leaves on trees gave them a nutritional advantage. More recent theories have argued that it gives them an edge in sexual selection or even that the increased surface area allows them to release more heat and regulate their skin temperature.",

    "description": "Photos by @jimmychin | I am heartbroken by the loss of my dear friend, climber and ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, in a skiing accident on September 26, on Manaslu, in Nepal. Thank you, Hilaree, for the shining light you brought to this world and for breaking the trail for so many. You were a true superhuman. Your strength, humility, and graciousness on and off the mountain have inspired me endlessly and will continue to inspire many generations to come. It’s been an honor to call you my friend. You will be dearly missed. My heart goes out to your family, Grayden, Quinn, and your steadfast partner, Jim Morrison.\n\nThese images are from a memorable Antarctica expedition two years ago, when Hilaree, Conrad Anker, Jim Morrison, and I summited Mount Vinson and attempted the first ski descent of Mount Tyree.\n\nPhoto 1: Hilaree\nPhoto 2: Hilaree and Jim postholing up Tyree\nPhoto 3: Jim and Hilaree on top of Vinson\nPhoto 4: Hilaree kicking steps up Tyree",

    "description": "Photo by @jasperdoest | A white stork searches for leftovers at a landfill in Portugal. Not too long ago, the white stork was a wholly migratory species that would breed on the European continent and migrate to Africa during the winter. However, since the 1980s, the year-round food supply at landfill sites like this one has resulted in the establishment of resident stork populations on the Iberian Peninsula. \n \nThe landfills have influenced the migration and facilitated the colonization of new areas. Now, with changes in EU waste legislation, open-air landfills are being replaced by facilities inaccessible to birds—which will again likely come with consequences for the storks' winter habitat, breeding, and migratory decisions.

    "description": "Photo by @beverlyjoubert | My, what teeth you have… No doubt it’s an impressive set, but unfortunately for the cheetah, not as impressive as it could be. These high-speed hunters pay an evolutionary price for their agility. Because they require large nasal passages to deliver the oxygen needed to power their impressive sprints, cheetahs are left with far less room in the skull to accommodate big teeth. Being light and lithe for maximum speed also makes them vulnerable to meal theft by larger predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas. It’s not easy being the fastest cat on the block.\n#cheetah #bigcats #bigcatsofinstagram",

In 2018, after more than a decade, Frank Pichardo, Sebastian Di Domenico, and @fundacion.jocotoco park rangers found this species, which many had believed was extinct, in a primary forest of the Chocó lowlands. Like this frog, many other species in the Chocó rainforest are also threatened by habitat loss, mining, palm-oil plantations, and other causes. But thanks to nonprofits such as @fundacion.jocotoco, this region and the animals that inhabit it have a chance to survive. There is still a lot of work to be done.

    "description": "Photos by @alessandro.cinque | Portrait of Epifania Ilaria, 52, and Mauro de la Cruz, 47, in traditional clothing during a ceremony in the plaza of Santa Barbara, in Peru's Huancavelica region. \n\nThe town is home to the oldest mine in Peru. During the Spanish colonial era, Indigenous Peruvians were enslaved as workers. The mine operated from 1566 to 1975. \n\nMauro de la Cruz is the leader of the campesino community near the Santa Barbara mine. They're lobbying UNESCO to designate the area a site of historical interest in hopes that tourism would economically benefit the community and their children.

Emerging at night, this species searches the seafloor, crawling in and out of rocky areas to flush out crabs and shrimp. Once prey is secured, the octopus will kill it with venom secreted from salivary glands before cracking the shell with its beak.

Eighty-five people were killed in Butte County, about 50,000 displaced. Roughly 19,000 structures—including 14,000 homes—were destroyed. There was no warning, and in a mere three hours, life had suddenly been split into that which came before the fire and the life to come after it.\nBirgitte Randall, a nurse, says many who remain in the town are living without a safety net. And everyone was affected, so residents couldn’t lean on neighbors who’d likely lost their homes and jobs themselves. \nFeather River Hospital was the biggest employer in town and was closed for a while after the fire. It’s where Randall and her mother, Denise Gundersen, also a nurse, had worked. “We gave good care at that hospital,” Randall says. \nRandall and her sister, Elisabeth Gundersen, a nurse practitioner, realized there were several gaping holes in the aid being delivered. Among them: medical care and housing, which were long-standing problems in the county, one of California’s poorest. \n\nTogether, the sisters and their mother helped create what became Medspire Health. It started as triage.

    "description": "Photos by @andreabruce Text by Rebecca Sanchez @rbeckslee | In our article in National Geographic magazine on “keepers of community,” read about sisters Elisabeth Gundersen and Birgitte Randall. They are part of the glue that holds their community together.\n\nFor residents of Paradise, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, November 8, 2018, was life changing. \nThe Camp fire, which made national headlines for being the deadliest firestorm in California’s modern history—and one of the most devastating in the U.S. in 100 years—had scorched the town of Paradise. Eighty-five people were killed in Butte County, about 50,000 displaced. Roughly 19,000 structures—including 14,000 homes—were destroyed. There was no warning, and in a mere three hours, life had suddenly been split into that which came before the fire and the life to come after it.\nBirgitte Randall, a nurse, says many who remain in the town are living without a safety net. And everyone was affected, so residents couldn’t lean on neighbors who’d likely lost their homes and jobs themselves. \nFeather River Hospital was the biggest employer in town and was closed for a while after the fire. It’s where Randall and her mother, Denise Gundersen, also a nurse, had worked. “We gave good care at that hospital,” Randall says. \nRandall and her sister, Elisabeth Gundersen, a nurse practitioner, realized there were several gaping holes in the aid being delivered. Among them: medical care and housing, which were long-standing problems in the county, one of California’s poorest. \n\nTogether, the sisters and their mother helped create what became Medspire Health. It started as triage. They held their first mobile clinic in March 2019. \n\nFollow the team's work at @medspirehealth.\n\nThis entire project exists with support from @catchlight.io, @photowings, @nationalwritingproject, and @lorraineustar.

    "description": "Photo by @jasperdoest | White storks gain altitude with the help of thermal winds. For this large bird, long-distance migration is partly dependent on gliding, which requires considerably less energy than having to flap its wings. The birds manage to do so by gliding on the warm thermal currents that rise over land, assisted by the prevailing winds. Thermal winds do not develop over large bodies of water, so sizable migratory birds such as storks and raptors are restricted mainly to land routes.\n\nI worked on a story about white storks, and soaring with the birds is certainly one of my all-time highlights. At one point, we had storks above and below us, a truly majestic feeling. Follow @jasperdoest for more images of the wonders of nature. #whitestork #birdmigration",

    "description": "Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | Morning in the Danum Valley, on Malaysian Borneo. This rainforest is estimated to be at least 130 million years old, making it one of the oldest in the world (twice as old as the Amazon rainforest). Extremely rich in biodiversity, Borneo provides habitat for about 15,000 known species of flowering plants, more than 3,000 tree species, 221 terrestrial mammal species, and 420 bird species. After years of work in Borneo, it's one of the places in the world deeply embedded in my heart!

We're also working on a National Geographic story about the Franklin expedition that disappeared in the passage in the 1840s. Here's an update (in Mark's words). \n\nTaya, the yellow boat, was rafted up next to us. It come in the night before, the sound of metal crunching against rock as they motored over a shoal to reach a safe haven within this icy bay. The wind had finally died down and the sun was shining, so I decided to go ashore with a dinghy to stretch my legs. When I got back to the boat in the afternoon, chunks of ice were breaking apart all around us, sending mini tsunamis through the bay. The \"boulder\" where we sheltered for a day and a half now appeared ready to topple—and possibly crush the boats. There was nowhere to go, but we couldn't stay. \n\nTaya set off first, and our boat, the Polar Sun, followed. At first we were only looking for a new spot to tie up. But after muscling past two huge floes, it became clear that we had to free ourselves from Pasley Bay. A light wind suddenly created small leads along the shore. Where there had been a glacial wall of ice the night before, we found an opening. And then another. And another.\n\nAt one point, the Polar Sun was so close to land I could have almost jumped off. Taya, which draws only three feet—meaning the depth of its lowest part in the water—was in front, radioing back the conditions. Two meters (six feet), the crew said. The Polar Sun draws six feet when it's not massively overloaded. I throttled up. If we hit the bottom, we'd somehow just have to power through. Renan was up front calling directions. An hour later, the Polar Sun and Taya were in open water. But the ice was not done with us yet. According to the most recent ice chart, it was closing back up. Through the binoculars, I saw another wall of ice ahead... Until next time. @expedition.studios #OnAssignment @natgeointhefield",

An hour later, the Polar Sun and Taya were in open water. But the ice was not done with us yet. According to the most recent ice chart, it was closing back up. Through the binoculars, I saw another wall of ice ahead... Until next time. @expedition.studios #OnAssignment @natgeointhefield",

    "description": "Video by @joelsartore | Very few Honduran club-tail iguanas, like this one @sacramentozoo, are involved in captive-breeding programs and few legal protections are in place for the species. That means it’s crucial to take action and save this species in the wild. While the club-tail iguana faces many threats that are hard to control, such as habitat loss and increasing numbers of invasive species that prey on them, we can help fight against the exotic pet trade and predation by feral dogs and cats. When looking for your next pet, remember that wild animals are best suited for life in the wild. Help protect wildlife by adopting a dog or a cat to reduce the number of domestic animals out on the streets. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me @joelsartore. #Honduran #iguana #clubtail #reptile #animal #wildlife #video #adoptdontshop #notapet #PhotoArk",

Before the Shinkansen, a conventional train traveling between Tokyo and Osaka took six hours and 30 minutes to complete the trip. Now the latest N700 trains, with a maximum speeds of 300 kph (180 mph), can complete the trip in as little as two hours and 25 minutes.

But the disappearance of some animals in particular would take a profound toll on the health and balance of ecosystems. Keystone species such as lions and elephants play an outsize role in maintaining the delicate structure of ecosystems. When they decline, that structure begins to weaken and break apart. The good news is that protecting these animals has a similarly powerful but positive impact. When we invest in conservation initiatives that help lions and elephants thrive, entire ecosystems and a multitude of other species benefit. #lions #elephants #wildlife #biodiversity",

This pit, 30 meters (100 ft) wide by 30 meters high, is where the experimental Iter (\"the way\" in Latin) machine is being assembled. The machine is designed to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion power. Can we gain net energy from fusing hydrogen atoms, potentially replacing fossil fuels? Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars: when light atomic nuclei fuse together to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released. The research is aimed at developing a safe, abundant, and environmentally responsible energy source. Read the full story at the link in bio. Follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.",

FIVE new northern white rhino embryos have been created, bringing the total to 22! It's a remarkable step from the extraordinary @biorescue_project, a team of scientists and conservationists from @leibnizizw, @OlPejeta conservancy, @safariparkdvurkralove, @kenyawildlifeservice, and Wildlife Research and Training Institute (WRTI).\n\nThis is a series of images from Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya where oocytes were collected from Fatu on July 28, 2022. This strengthens the hope of producing offspring and giving this keystone species a brighter future. The consortium  values and respects the life and welfare of the individual animals. Veterinary and ethical assessments of the oocyte collection indicate that Fatu has tolerated the procedures well.\n\nFollow @amivitale and @biorescue_project to learn more, including how to help.\n\n#Conservation #Kenya #StopPoaching @MinistryOfTourismAndWildlifeKE #NorthernWhiteRhinos #rhinos",

    "description": "Photos by @jimmychin | Travis Rice (@travisrice) is a mountain freeride snowboarder (and a filmmaker and designer) who's hailed as one of the most renowned riders of the sport.\n\nTravis Rice is certainly one of the most creative athletes I’ve ever worked with. His eye for what is rideable down big mountains is second to none. He sees the mountain differently than everyone else in his sport. But it’s not just his ability as a big mountain (and park and pipe) snowboarder that makes him incredible—it's also his meticulous attention to detail in terms of how snowboarding is captured. His instincts and sensibilities for filming  snowboarding is as visionary as his riding. \n\nIn 2016 Rice was riding in the backcountry of Alaska, film crew in tow, when the mountain’s snowpack \"spider-webbed\" around him, catapulting him into an avalanche. In his episode, he reflects on the near-fatal mistake that forced him into unknown territory and shares how the event has shaped his approach to big-mountain riding—and life.\n\nThe episode “Riding the Avalanche” premieres Tuesday, Sept. 13, at 10/9c. All episodes of \"Edge of the Unknown with Jimmy Chin\" are available now on Disney+.",

These majestic animals may be intimidating to their prey, but they are also threatened: African lions have disappeared from 94 percent of their historic range and are listed as vulnerable to extinction.

    "description": "Photo by @jasperdoest | Morning fog dances over the rainforest canopy in Lopé National Park. Gabon is the second most forested country on Earth, forming part of the great Congo Basin rainforest that stretches across central Africa. In tropical rainforests, fog is produced from the temperature changes between day and night. As the rainforest warms, the water in the atmosphere evaporates and forms clouds—which generate rain the next day.\n\nWith its transpiration and evaporation processes, the tropical rainforest plays a key role in regulating Earth's water cycle. These rainforests help regulate rainfall throughout Africa, carrying water to the Blue Nile, which helps maintain the stability of the African continent.\n\nThis image was created during a licensed drone flight and was taken in accordance with local regulations.

    "description": "Video by @bertiegregory and Johnny Rogers (@irish_camera) | A pod of pilot whales cruises at the surface 30 miles (50 km) off the coast of Costa Rica. The animals’ name is a little misleading. These pods were thought to be “piloted” by a single leader, but that’s not true. Furthermore, pilot whales are actually dolphins. The chunky section just in front of their tail is the caudal peduncle. In this video, that area is tall and packed full of muscle, allowing them to dive fast and deep to reach their squid prey. Filmed for “Epic Adventures With Bertie Gregory,” now streaming on @disneyplus. #EpicAdventuresWithBertieGregory",

The queen attended the parade on horseback until 1986, when she began riding in a carriage.\nEvery summer the queen invited as many as 8,000 people who had “made a positive impact in their community” to her garden party on the lawn of Buckingham Palace, where she walked around and greeted them individually. She always wore clothes that would stand out in a crowd- she’s a tiny figure in bright green in the upper left corner of image 6.\nI photographed the queen for the National Geographic book Discovering Britain and Ireland, and was allowed on the roof of Buckingham Palace with the official palace photographer—in the pouring rain.",

    "description": "Photos by Jodi Cobb @jodicobbphoto |\nQueen Elizabeth II in London in 1984\nThe balcony appearance is the centerpiece of royal celebrations in Britain, a chance for the public to see the royal family gathered for a grand photo. Every June the queen’s official birthday was celebrated: an extravagant military parade known as Trooping the Colour that concluded with the balcony moment.  The queen attended the parade on horseback until 1986, when she began riding in a carriage.\nEvery summer the queen invited as many as 8,000 people who had “made a positive impact in their community” to her garden party on the lawn of Buckingham Palace, where she walked around and greeted them individually. She always wore clothes that would stand out in a crowd- she’s a tiny figure in bright green in the upper left corner of image 6.\nI photographed the queen for the National Geographic book Discovering Britain and Ireland, and was allowed on the roof of Buckingham Palace with the official palace photographer—in the pouring rain.",

About 256,000 hectares (945 square miles) of a commercial forest will be developed, including 6,000 hectares reserved for a central government district. The new capital is projected to open in 2024, with the presidential palace among its first buildings. Construction is expected to continue up to 2045—which would coincide with Indonesia’s 100th anniversary of independence. \n \nOn the island of Java, the crowded current capital, in Jakarta, frequently battles flooding and rising seas. The city was built on a delta, with 40 percent below sea level. With Nusantara, Indonesia could start with a clean slate. Yet questions about how the megaproject will affect vegetation, wildlife, riparian areas, and the Native Paser Balik people remain to be answered.\n \nRead the full story at the link in bio.

    "description": "Video by @danwintersphoto | The SLS rocket sits atop the pad at Launch Complex 39B, Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida, September 2. \n\nAfter two scrubbed launch attempts in one week, @nasa decided to stand down when it was unable to repair a hydrogen leak in the fuel line during the countdown on the second scheduled launch day. The next attempt will be in October, at the earliest, and the SLS rocket will most likely have to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building, unless NASA is able to repair the leak on the pad itself and can get a waiver to leave the rocket there until the next attempt. \n\nToday we will pick up remote cameras we set two weeks ago inside the launch pad perimeter, hoping to capture this historic liftoff that signals the the return of humans to the moon. For now, we plan to be back in October to cover the third attempt.

    "description": "Photo by Cristina Mittermeier @mitty | It’s hard to convey in words the kind of power Antarctica’s wild icescapes have over the human spirit. Drifting through the maze of glass palaces and towering icebergs is like stepping into a painting or a dream. The cold glow of the polar south’s light casts hazy shadows and paints the skies of dusk in swaths of crimson and indigo. Not only is it beautiful to behold, but it is also a critical sanctuary for an astounding array of life. Pods of Antarctic minke whales and seals roam the inky depths of the ocean. Penguins stream beyond the reach of the sun’s rays to chase clouds of krill, and high above, the mighty wingspan of the albatross commands the winds. But even amid what appears to be a flourishing ecosystem, the effects of climate change, overfishing, and pollution can be found eating away at its heart. If we are to succeed in reviving our seas, we must protect Antarctica—the icy heartbeat of our planet.",

Those led to some 30 deaths and thousands of injuries, and deeply shook the country, one of the most stable in Latin America.\n\nThe election of a new president, Gabriel Boric, on March 11, 2022, was seen as a product of the 2019 protests. At 36, Boric is the youngest president in Chile's history and a former student protest leader.",

Rewind far enough and you can imagine them roaming far beyond their present-day territories—from the savannas and steppes of Central America to the plains of southeastern Europe. Today’s lions lay claim to a much-diminished kingdom, and even that is under increasing threat as development and habitat destruction fragment and encircle it. Without space—without protected wilderness—lions will continue to vanish. To safeguard a future for these magnificent predators, we need to make sure they have enough room to roam. #lions #bigcats #bigcatconservation",

    "description": "Photo by @danwintersphoto | Today's scheduled launch of NASA's Artemis I test flight was scrubbed this morning due to a hydrogen leak in the fuel line. After multiple efforts were made to fix the leak during countdown, the launch was officially called off. The first attempt, scheduled for Monday, August 29, was also scrubbed, due to minor mechanical issues that could not be solved on the pad within the launch window. Weather also played a part on that day, as significant thunderstorms materialized in the area around @nasakennedy.\n\nAt approximately 4:45 p.m. EDT today NASA announced that the launch will be moved to a later date, possibly mid-October at the earliest—in order to make the repairs, the spacecraft will have to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building. In the meantime, the SLS rocket sits atop the pad at Launch Complex 39B. The goal of the initial uncrewed Artemis mission is to gather data on all spacecraft systems, leading the way for future crewed Artemis missions to the moon.

    "description": "Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | I found these lions in late morning doing what lions do—lying there. The dark-maned brothers had most likely been patrolling all night. At the time, the light was not optimal for photography, and I knew they wouldn’t go far, so I would return later and dedicate the afternoon to following them. I imagined the picture: they would stretch, roll, and nuzzle each other for a bit, and then perhaps stand to send out contact roars to the females.\n\nAs I arrived, the sky began to swell, the clouds a welcome respite from the afternoon heat. I parked for a view of the mound, with composition in mind. I watched as the aerial masterpiece continued. But the lions did not move. Rays of sun exploded through billowing cracks. The lions rolled over. The sun found a circular hole in the sky cover, and the termite mound exploded in a beam of gold. The lions did not move. I would wait until they got up. I was ready with a wide-angle lens. They never got up. \n\nThe sun met the horizon. The afterglow continued into a crescendo. The lions lay flat. Perhaps they knew what I'd come for and laughed at my confidence, or they wanted to test my resolve. Or, just maybe, they wanted me to look beyond them and remember the larger picture we are all a part of. #lions #bigcats #wildlife #lionking",

    "description": "Photo by @martinedstrom | Dragon's blood trees have drawn people to Socotra for millennia. This little island in the middle of the Arabian Sea has been a trading post since the Greeks first described the world—and has since been touched by most civilizations. The red resin of these trees—the liquid called dragon's blood—was harvested and traded in ancient times, and it still is today. An icon of Socotra, the tree is also a national symbol for Yemen—it even graces the 20 rial coins of the country's currency. Photographed for @natgeo in 2018, for a story about Socotra’s future in the midst of extreme pressure from climate change as well as political storms. #dragonsbloodisland #yemen #socotra",

Each group is slightly different in their social structures and language. Pod members spend their lives following in the wake of their wise matriarch, hanging on to her every instruction in order to hunt and navigate the seas. The matriarch is usually the oldest female that learned everything she needs to lead her family from her mother and grandmother. It’s this intergenerational wisdom that allows orcas to thrive in all kinds of marine environments around the world, passing on traditional knowledge much in the same way we pass our own culture and skills to our children. It’s deeply humbling to know we share our planet with such extraordinary animals that, as it turns out, are not so different from us.",

Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars: when light atomic nuclei fuse together to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released. Fusion research is aimed at developing a safe, abundant, and environmentally responsible energy source. \n\nITER is under construction in Saint-Paul-les-Durance, in the south of France, and it's a global effort. Europe is contributing almost half of the construction costs, while the other six members of the venture—China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the United States—are funding the rest. This panel is one of nine sections of ITER’s vacuum vessel, freshly shipped to France from South Korea. Read the full story at the link in bio. Follow @paoloverzone for more pictures and stories.",

    "description": "Photos by @jimmychin | Legendary climber Conrad Anker has been pushing the limits of mountaineering for the past 30 years, evolving into one of the best alpinists in history. Based in Bozeman, Montana, he’s one of the most prolific explorers alive today. He’s equally at home in Antarctica, in the Himalaya, or on his home ice in Hyalite Canyon.\n\n@conradanker has been my friend, mentor, and climbing partner for more than 20 years. I owe much of my life trajectory as a climber, photographer, and filmmaker to him. Conrad gave me a chance to come shoot with him when I first began making pictures, and it was my launching pad as a photographer. He paved the way for me to join the North Face Athletes team, of which I’ve been a member for over two decades, and he invited me on my first National Geographic expedition, where I learned how to film. We have been all over the world together, and he’s been my climbing partner on my most significant climbs.\n\nIn his episode of “Edge of the Unknown With Jimmy Chin,” Conrad faces one of his most difficult moments of survival in the mountains. After suffering a heart attack while hanging 20,000 feet (6,100m) from the side of Lunag Ri, then the tallest unclimbed Himalayan peak, he and his climbing partner, the late David Lama, have to fight their way back to Base Camp. Conrad is one of the toughest people I know, and self-rescuing from this Himalayan first ascent certainly proved the point. He recounts his astonishing experience and explains how his heart attack and age have modulated his risk threshold.\n\nRenowned mountaineer and professional climber Conrad Anker’s episode, “Return to Life,” premieres Tuesday, Sept. 6, at 10:30/9:30c.\n\n“Edge of the Unknown With Jimmy Chin” premieres Monday, Sept. 5, at 9:30/8:30c on National Geographic, and all episodes will be available on Disney+ on Wednesday, Sept. 7.",

    "description": "Photos by @jimmychin | Legendary climber Conrad Anker has been pushing the limits of mountaineering for the past 30 years, evolving into one of the best alpinists in history. Based in Bozeman, Montana, he’s one of the most prolific explorers alive today. He’s equally at home in Antarctica, in the Himalaya, or on his home ice in Hyalite Canyon.\n\n@conradanker has been my friend, mentor, and climbing partner for more than 20 years. I owe much of my life trajectory as a climber, photographer, and filmmaker to him. Conrad gave me a chance to come shoot with him when I first began making pictures, and it was my launching pad as a photographer. He paved the way for me to join the North Face Athletes team, of which I’ve been a member for over two decades, and he invited me on my first National Geographic expedition, where I learned how to film. We have been all over the world together, and he’s been my climbing partner on my most significant climbs.\n\nIn his episode of “Edge of the Unknown With Jimmy Chin,” Conrad faces one of his most difficult moments of survival in the mountains. After suffering a heart attack while hanging 20,000 feet (6,100m) from the side of Lunag Ri, then the tallest unclimbed Himalayan peak, he and his climbing partner, the late David Lama, have to fight their way back to Base Camp. Conrad is one of the toughest people I know, and self-rescuing from this Himalayan first ascent certainly proved the point. He recounts his astonishing experience and explains how his heart attack and age have modulated his risk threshold.\n\nRenowned mountaineer and professional climber Conrad Anker’s episode, “Return to Life,” premieres Tuesday, Sept. 6, at 10:30/9:30c.\n\n“Edge of the Unknown With Jimmy Chin” premieres Monday, Sept. 5, at 9:30/8:30c on National Geographic, and all episodes will be available on Disney+ on Wednesday, Sept. 7.",

    "description": "Photo by Dan Winters @danwintersphoto | The 322-foot-tall Artemis I Orion spacecraft sits in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida, just prior to rolling out to the pad. Its uncrewed launch was planned to take place August 29 at KSC's Launch Complex 39B, used 53 years ago to launch Apollo 10. However, due to an engine issue on the rocket, the launch has been postponed. NASA is evaluating the problem to see if they can try again as soon as September 2. Once launched, it will circle the moon on a roughly 40-day mission. Artemis I, the most powerful rocket ever built, delivers 8.8 million pounds of thrust and will ultimately serve as the vehicle that will once again deliver astronauts to the moon. \n\nFollow me @danwintersphoto for continuing coverage. @nasa @nasaartemis @nasakennedy @nasajohnson @nasa_michoud @nasa_marshall #nasa #artemis #kennedyspacecenter",

During the last few years, the International Indigenous Women Foundation has implemented a program in Latin America, working with women from Indigenous communities, to retake ancestral practices that will lead them and their families toward food sovereignty. The community of Cayun was chosen to develop this program, which includes workshops and the installation of greenhouses and chicken coops.

Hedgehogs are able to completely fold in on themselves and protect their most vulnerable body parts thanks to strong back muscles that function like the strings on a drawstring pouch. As the ball tightens, the exterior spines become more erect and crisscross each other, forming an almost impenetrable barrier. Video taken @albustanzoo in the United Arab Emirates.

Then suddenly he paused to lift his snout and looked curiously toward the shore at our little zodiac. We were about 200 feet (60 m) away from him, but he still managed to catch our scent. Eventually, he turned his attention back to his path until he became completely indistinguishable from the snowscape. Polar bears are powerful, incredibly beautiful animals, and I’ve had the immense privilege of photographing quite a few over my career. Their habitat in the Arctic is undergoing drastic changes, but I know if we act today, we can protect the future of these bears forever. #winterwonderland #svalbard",

Mont Blanc's glacier, Mer de Glace (Sea of Ice), the largest in France, has shrunk more than one and a quarter miles (two km) and lost over 25% of its thickness over the last century due to rising temperatures—proof that even this ancient formation can't stand up to a changing climate.

In 2014, 33 percent of the population was above the age of 60, a number that continues to increase.

She first made a scarecrow out of necessity for her crops, and being an artist she crafted the face after her father's. She soon began making more scarecrows and placing them around the town, juxtaposing them in various positions of work and play, representing what humans once did in the village. Dolls overtake abandoned spaces, and houses lie in ruins. You can explore more of my work on social issues @nadiashiracohen.",

It's designed to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion power. Fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars: when light atomic nuclei fuse together to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released. Fusion research is aimed at developing a safe, abundant, and environmentally responsible energy source. Seen here, the oval-shaped superconducting magnets (center, between the white pillars) are among the largest components of the ITER machine. Read the full story at the link in bio.

    "description": "Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | When most people think about a safari in Africa, they think of a trip during high season, usually the months of June through October, which, of course, is hands-down incredible. Indeed, sightings are epic. The land is dusty, hot, and brown. The tall grasses are gone. And since the animals must come to drink, a water hole is a perfect place to be positioned at.\n\nBut there is another magical time for an African safari, one that many never consider. Rainy season not only is a less expensive time to visit but also offers a completely different landscape—one of technicolor green backgrounds, flowers, and golden light. Sure, dense foliage and thick grasses sometimes pose a bit of a challenge spotting predators. But when you do find them, the images to be made are of a completely different level of awesome.\n\nI had no trouble finding furries on this trip to Botswana. And I didn’t just find the predators—I found their baby versions. Two different families of leopard cubs and their mothers, and two different families of lion cubs and lionesses, graced the days. Botswana unveiled scene after scene of photographic opportunity, from African wild dogs to big cats to hippos, elephants, and rhinos. I think the rainy season is my new favorite time to visit. \n\nFor more stories of animals, follow me @kaigner. #babyanimals #bigcats #babies #lioncubs #lions #africa #travel #botswana",

During this moment, we watched in awe as an abyss of darkness opened up above. Stars and planets were faintly visible in the void where blue sky would have been.\n\nFor more stories, follow me @itsreuben.",

    "description": "Photo by @stephenwilkes | So excited to share my latest Day to Night photograph. I am honored that it's the cover story for @natgeo's “America the Beautiful” issue. This Day to Night photograph of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah is one of four I created for the September 2022 magazine.\n\nThe spectacular landscape of Bears Ears Monument is a symbol of the risk to some of the country's unique and irreplaceable places. One president preserved it at the urging of Native Americans who hold it sacred; another tried to open it to drilling and mining.\n\nA national monument rich with archaeological sites, it includes the Citadel, once a fortified cliff dwelling, now a popular hiking spot. I took 2,092 photographs over 36 hours and selected 44 for this image. Beyond the sense of awe and beauty, there's a palpable sense of history with every step you take.\n\nBears Ears was one of the most challenging Day to Nights I have created. After a long day of traveling, my team and I hiked more than an hour with several hundred pounds of gear to our shoot location and set up camp for the next three days. Over the duration of our shoot, we photographed while battling steady 45-mile-an-hour winds, and we were blessed to be able to capture the sunrise, a full moon, and a rare alignment of the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.\n\nI want to give special thanks to the incredible team @natgeo, including @dominiqueanneh, @sadiequarrier, @whitneycatherinejohnson, and @emma_marris. I also want to thank our local producer, @mcummingsphoto, as well as my assistants @lennychristopher, @ivar_bas, and @moran3970, and our Navajo guide, @louisdwilliams20. This photograph would not have been possible without their support. I’m looking forward to sharing more photographs from this important story, so stay tuned! \n\nRead the full story at the link in bio.

    "description": "Photo by Cristina Mittermeier @mitty | Torrents of cardinalfish raced past my lens to avoid a Galápagos sea lion overhead. Even as I lifted my camera to frame the pinniped gliding against the surface, I had to fight to keep myself in place. The current yanked me back toward the reef, and high above I could hear the hiss of a powerful wave striking the rocks. Dizzy from the effort of keeping steady and swarmed by living streams of fish, I managed to squeeze the shutter just in time to make the image. With Ecuador’s announcement last year to expand the Galápagos, I cannot wait to see this stronghold of marine life truly flourishing. What kind of world could we have if we not only restore our ocean but also help it thrive like never before? Diving here makes me believe in a better future—one beyond our wildest imagination. #galapagos #sealion #biodiversity",

Scientists drill ice cores to measure the concentration of greenhouse gases, in order to learn how much methane is broken down in the Arctic Ocean and how much of the gas ultimately reaches the atmosphere. As a photographer, I'm interested in the scientists who deliver such critical climate data to us and how they live and work in one of the harshest environments on our planet. Working in thin gloves in -35° temperatures is hard on the hands. You have to constantly monitor yourself and other members of the expedition for frostbite on hands and faces.

To the west—pictured here—lies a band of limestone that forms the lesser peaks of Mount Api and Mount Benarat. These lower slopes are covered in dense tropical rainforest and are riddled with giant cave systems that include some of the largest caves ever discovered. In the early evening on most days, a huge storm passes through Mulu and soaks everything—over time, that rain has helped sculpt the enormous caverns below.",

    "description": "Photo by Luján Agusti @lujanag | Portrait of one of the oldest couples in the Indigenous Mapuche community of Cayún, the philosophical Lonko Florentino Cayun and Albina Cayulef, in their vegetable garden. Some 130 years ago, the Cayún lof—the Indigenous term for \"community\"— fled toward the province of Neuquén at the Argentine border with Chile. Like hundreds of other Native communities in Argentina, they were dispossessed of their lands by a military operation called the \"conquest of the desert.\" La Piedra de Trompul (Trompul's Stone), an area surrounded by national forests in the basin of the Lácar lake, became their new home. Today, between 80 and 90 people live at this place, more than 1,000 meters (3,000ft) above sea level, where winters threaten to destroy harvests and can isolate families for weeks.

    "description": "Photo by Cristina Mittermeier @mitty | The fog rose from the river’s surface and settled high in the treetops in British Columbia’s Great Bear Rainforest. Far across the water, I could just make out a pair of brown bears crossing between the misty banks—pausing here and there to inspect the currents for salmon. I knew that just beyond the towering canopies of wise, old conifers, the sweeping wilderness inevitably met urban life marked by winding roads and sleepy towns. But here in the mountains, animals like bears seem almost tiny. I took this photo as a reminder that there is space for all the wild creatures we share our planet with, as long as we leave our forests and rivers intact.

We documented an international team of researchers, led by Nele Meckler from the University of Bergen, who are reconstructing the ancient tropical climate using dripstones as archives of past climate change. They'll study temperature and drip-water chemistry inside the caves in order to better understand the signals in the rocks.",

    "description": "Video by @andrea_frazzetta | The Appian Way is the most famous Roman road still in existence—and Europe’s first major highway.\nIn its roughly 360-mile span across the country, the road takes many forms: a forested dirt path, a town plaza, a busy east-west highway. It’s not always scenic or pleasant, but it’s an immersion into a side of southern Italy few tourists see.\nTo realize this project, I traveled and walked for seven weeks.\nAt the end of my journey, I rediscovered my country as I’d never imagined I would. I was amazed by the beauty and outraged by the ugliness of the road’s current state of disrepair.\nProtection is now under way, but without visitors, the Appia could be forgotten again.\nAs Riccardo Carnovalini, one of the most prominent Italian hikers, told me when I met with him on the trail: “Walking is the most political act one can do to change the landscape.”\n\nFollow me @andrea_frazzetta for more images from this project. #Italy #appianway #Roma #lastrada @natgeotravel",

Moises Saman traveled through Yemen alongside @ahmedbaider to document how war is affecting its people and rich cultural heritage. In Marib, members of a wedding party made up of local tribesmen visit the ruins of the nearly 3,000-year-old Awwam Temple, where Sabaeans once worshipped their god of irrigation and agriculture. The temples of Marib are at risk as Houthis fight to seize the city. Read the full story at the link in bio.",

    "description": "Photo by @paoloverzone | Tim Luce, chief scientist of ITER, the giant experimental fusion reactor now under construction in southern France, stands in the pit that will house the donut-shaped tokamak. In the tokamak, hydrogen nuclei will be heated to hundreds of millions of degrees and fused into helium. ITER—designed to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion power—will be the world's largest reactor. Nuclear fusion is the power source of the sun and the stars. When light atomic nuclei fuse together to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released. Fusion research is aimed at developing a safe, abundant, and environmentally responsible energy source. Read the full story at the link in bio and follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.",

In fact, they spend most of their time just hanging out. It’s easy to interpret this as laziness, but it’s actually very smart. If you live in a prey-rich environment, it pays to stay still and let the food come to you. There’s an added bonus: Because you’re still and quiet, you have the element of surprise. This is, of course, assuming you can wake up in time! I’m always staggered by a lion’s ability to go from fast asleep to full hunt mode in seconds. Photographed with special drone permissions for my new show coming later this year to @disneyplus. #EpicAdventuresWithBertieGregory",

    "description": "Photos by Pete McBride @pedromcbride | Water Pressure: The Colorado River Basin continues to get thirstier, forcing adaptation whether we like it or not. The megadrought is requiring the seven states along this key lifeline to make drastic cuts in an effort to conserve four million acre-feet of water for next year, about one-third of the river's annual flow.\n\nMost of those steep cuts will need to come from agriculture and the lower basin states, which use more water than they are allocated. I’ve documented the Colorado from source to sea over the course of a decade, and I'm still amazed that we ran the river dry—it no longer reaches the sea—and that few realize how precious and scarce this lifeline is. For more on our changing environments, follow @pedromcbride. #water #conservation #ColoradoRiver #drought #watershortage #environment  #petemcbride",

On this cold, gray, and snowy day, a family of orcas swam purposefully across a fjord, and I watched them for a while, curious about their destination. Quietly slipping into the sea, I saw this scene, and it struck me as a mourning procession, a family in grief. Possessing high levels of cognition, orcas, and whales in general, live complex lives that we are only just beginning to understand.",

In “Keepers of Community,” our upcoming article in the September issue of National Geographic, read about Mark Covington and his work bringing community gardens to Detroit. He is part of the glue that holds his community together.\n\nWhen Covington started planting seeds on an empty lot in his Detroit neighborhood, he didn’t expect that the community would start to grow around the growth of his garden. But little by little the seeds, now literal and figurative, took root, as the hands on the garden that would evolve into a farm multiplied. On November 2, 2008—the afternoon he was baptized—Covington made the farm official, inviting loved ones to a celebratory dinner and asking them to serve as board members.\n\n“It’s somewhat spiritual, for me,” he says. “It’s like a sanctuary. People come here and don’t want to leave.”\n\nWhat began as a vacant lot and an effort to remove trash and deter littering has turned into a site of communion. On the southwest corner: a public community garden, with vegetable and flower beds; movie screens; and picnic tables. On the southeast: the fruit orchard and pollinator garden. In the northeast: the community and education center, farm, and zoo. Further down the street are a youth house and garlic beds. And in the northwest: houses that Covington hopes will one day be restored for anyone in need. \n\nIn this collection of images, the greenhouses, gardens, and animals of Georgia Street Community Collective are shared with residents of the neighborhood.

    "description": "Photos by @MartinEdstrom | Can you feel a connection to stone? After spending a full week photographing Stonehenge, from early dawn to right before sunrise, I’m inclined to say yes. Access to these ancient stones is usually quite restricted, to keep them safe, but we were fortunate to be able to capture the site in peace. In the last photo, a drone capture by @pauljoy, you can see me and @oliverakermo spread out across the ancient circle of stones in our daily dance to capture the boulders from all possible angles. Making a 3D model takes time, and we had to be sure to capture every single detail of each and every stone. By the end of our week at the site, I knew every stone and block by heart. And while we still can’t be certain of exactly what has transpired here in the past, there is definitely some sort of magic in the site. I deeply recommend a visit if you can—and if not, be sure to explore Stonehenge through the @natgeo AR filter on Instagram.\n#Stonehenge #3D #AR #immersive",

    "description": "Photos by @MartinEdstrom | Can you feel a connection to stone? After spending a full week photographing Stonehenge, from early dawn to right before sunrise, I’m inclined to say yes. Access to these ancient stones is usually quite restricted, to keep them safe, but we were fortunate to be able to capture the site in peace. In the last photo, a drone capture by @pauljoy, you can see me and @oliverakermo spread out across the ancient circle of stones in our daily dance to capture the boulders from all possible angles. Making a 3D model takes time, and we had to be sure to capture every single detail of each and every stone. By the end of our week at the site, I knew every stone and block by heart. And while we still can’t be certain of exactly what has transpired here in the past, there is definitely some sort of magic in the site. I deeply recommend a visit if you can—and if not, be sure to explore Stonehenge through the @natgeo AR filter on Instagram.\n#Stonehenge #3D #AR #immersive",

Down from a high of about 4,000 in the late 1950s, an estimated 330 drive-ins are still operating in the country. For the historic drive-ins that remain, the pandemic brought interest from new customers. Here, visitors at the Family Drive-In Theatre in Stephens City, Virginia, watch the first film of the night at the two-screen drive-in, which opened 65 years ago.

    "description": "Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | Out here, we don’t get to choose. As the light on the wild landscape turns perfect, the  thorn tree log, long fallen, with deep, dark lines and a gnarled character, would make the ideal frame for a spotted cat. But there isn’t one around. The bare termite mound stands against a looming stormy sky laced with sunset accents—seemingly begging for a perfectly maned male lion to appear. But the landscape is empty and epic. We know the animals are here—their travel stories are written in the sand, their tracks cross ours not long after we’ve driven by. We want to see them. We get anxious. We have come over oceans. We have spent money and time to lay eyes on that which the travel books promise. \n\nBut the bush does not exist to appease our human demands and desires. It keeps us acutely aware of our small place in the wild world, teaching us patience and mindfulness. But there is always a moment, the space between our desires and acceptance, when nature chooses to unveil what we seek. \n\nThe leopard and her daughter spent two hours here, allowing us a window to their world. As the sun began its departure, they rose, melting into the bushes. We drove to the other side, hoping for more time. And there they were, wrapped in each other and the light, more than we ever could have hoped for. Africa, you never disappoint. #leopard #bigcats #babyanimals #cats #catsofIG",

Once we’d finished photographing the creature, we put it back exactly where we found it. While we were there, we documented an international team of researchers—led by Nele Meckler from the University of Bergen, in Norway—aiming to reconstruct a tropical climate from far back in time. Using ancient dripstones as archives of past climate changes, they will study temperatures and drip water chemistry inside the caves in order to better understand the signals in the rocks.",

While most of the adults accepted them without issue, two of the larger juveniles in the pride had shown a little too much interest. They'd wait for the mother to get distracted before coming over to mess with the little cubs. The mother would soon come charging over. Growling, snarling, and some boxing solved the problem. Filmed in Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park for my new show, coming later this year to @disneyplus. #EpicAdventuresWithBertieGregory",

Even as they sank a little further into the plush sand with each lapping wave, they stood firmly planted on the shores of their ancestors. Facing the future takes incredible courage, especially for our younger generations. The planet is changing; fishnets are turning up empty, plastic is choking out wildlife, and natural disasters are becoming the norm. And yet, looking at these three girls with their boards clutched to their sides, I feel hope. The future will be won through courageous action taken every day as we look toward a better tomorrow.

    "description": "Footage by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | A before-and-after drone shot of our land and agroforestry project, after a devastating fire hit it two weeks ago during a heat wave here in Portugal.\nIt was a hot day, and we were preparing for a workshop on regenerative agriculture. Then smoke appeared behind the hill. The rest of the day turned into a surreal experience. I witnessed the fire creep up on our land and turn more than two years of passionate work, planting a forest of around 1,500 trees and plants, to ashes in a few hours. I never thought the fire would climb all the way to the street and burn our brick houses, a caravan, and more. Fueled by adrenaline, I rushed here and there, emptying our main water-irrigation pipe down below toward the fire and trying to save what I could. But at some point, you must leave when the flames are too close, too big—and when the police and firefighters bring you to reality, telling you to get the hell out. You back up and just watch helplessly, like everyone else, trying to mentally guide the fire away. You watch its dance, its work of destruction. Then days pass and you think of it as a work of renewal, and any green blade is a miracle again. That’s where I stand now. More determined than ever to create more resilience, plant more trees, create more awareness. #forestfire #climatechange #resilience #regeneration",

Super funky and otherworldly in appearance, they get some or most of their food from trapping and consuming animals or protozoans, typically insects and other arthropods. Nepenthes, like other carnivorous plants, have adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients.

His name was Safdar Ali, a Sufi pilgrim. I asked if I could take a picture; he left and came back holding a goat. “Now you can take a picture,” he said. Often the best image is born from collaboration. \n\nI followed Ali on his two-week pilgrimage across south Pakistan. He told me, “You know, we have all come from the same stream, which has split into many rivers.” This image is part of an ongoing passion project I am working on, “The Softness of Men.” For more insights into our world, please follow @paleyphoto. #oldwizard",

    "description": "Video by @babaktafreshi | From the roof of Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, let’s fly out to almost five billion light-years away, where a galaxy cluster is revealed by @nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope. The image of Webb’s First Deep Field offers the sharpest infrared view of the universe so far. \n\nStriking facts: The video begins with a wide-angle view of the sky that I photographed in southern Kenya and has a similar angle to our own eyes’ field of view. Webb’s First Deep Field is several thousand times smaller, “approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length,” as NASA described it.\n\nIn my second image, shot using a telephoto lens, the square marking the deep field area in the southern constellation Volans is still extremely small and shows just a blank background when zoomed in. The objects here are barely perceptible and so distant that the field remains blank to a professional telescope. Thousands of galaxies—including the faintest objects ever observed in infrared—appears in this 12-hour total exposure by Webb. The galaxy cluster is SMACS 0723. Its light belongs to 4.6 billion years ago, when Earth was just about to form. The combined mass of this galaxy cluster acts as a gravitational lens, magnifying much more distant galaxies behind it and distorting their image to extended arcs.\n\nWebb’s First Deep Field photo by NASA (@nasa), ESA, CSA, and STScI\nMusic by composer Barbad Bayat. #astronomy #nasawebb #kilimanjaro #twanight",

Last summer the city invested in providing free testing around town. Joe, as he's known, works for Coronabike, a locally developed and government-subsidized company that does mobile testing seven days a week. Passersby can be tested free of charge by trained staff and receive results within 15 minutes. The testing facilities all use solar lanterns to illuminate their workspace once the sun goes down. This portrait demonstrates the work that these employees have done on a daily basis to help reduce risk at public gathering spaces.

    "description": "Video by @joelsartore | A spoon-billed sandpiper @wwtslimbridge in Gloucestershire, U.K., is the 13,000th species to be added to the Photo Ark. This is one of the remaining birds from a captive-rearing project undertaken as part of a wider work to save this critically endangered species.\n\nWith the population of spoon-billed sandpipers plummeting, mainly due to habitat loss, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust took a lead role in efforts to buy time to reverse this trend. This included a conservation breeding project at WWT headquarters in Slimbridge, England, where significant advances were made in incubation and rearing methods. These methods have since been used in many other species recovery projects.\n\nThe spoon-billed sandpiper is a flagship species for the conservation of vital wetlands for migratory waterbirds along the East Asian–Australasian flyway, which stretches from the far north of Russia down to New Zealand. Protecting this charismatic wading bird, known affectionately as the spoonie, will help save millions of other birds and the wetlands they inhabit.\n\nFollow @joelsartore to see more creatures featured in the Photo Ark. #bird #animal #spoonbill #spoonie #wildlife #video #footage #endangered #PhotoArk",

    "description": "Video by @joelsartore | Raccoons, like this crab-eating raccoon at @elparquedelasleyendas in Lima, Peru, have some of the most nimble hands seen in nature. In fact, this species was actually named for its skillful paws, with “raccoon” coming from the Powhatan word “aroughcun” (when translated, this means “animal that scratches with its hands”). While most animals rely on sight, scent, or sound to hunt, these mammals depend on their sense of touch to locate food. To heighten this sense, raccoons will do something called dousing, in which they wet their paws to stimulate nerve endings.

Pangolins are generally nocturnal, preferring to hunt when conditions are cooler and under the cover of darkness. They're also one of the most illegally trafficked animals on Earth due to their keratin scales, used in traditional Chinese medicine; they're made of the same protein as a rhino horn or a human fingernail. Law enforcement seizures of pangolin scales and meat reached an all-time high in 2019. Worldwide, more than 128 tons were intercepted—an increase of more than 200 percent from five years earlier.",

    "description": "Photo by @johnstanmeyer | Feeling tired after a ceremony for the village's ancestral spirits, Dominikus Weu, a mystic known as a Musaluki Puu, takes a rest among wafting incense, in the village of Woloara on the Indonesian island of Flores. For a story on volcano mysticism, I spent two days with Dominikus and his fellow shamans, who live near the top of Mount Kelimutu, an ancient, sacred volcano. I recall how Dominikus described his culture's connection to my favorite number, 7—how only seven shamans at one time are granted their powers, selected through an elaborate hand and finger counting process only found within the Lio tribe of Flores. Sometimes I wonder whether he's still alive and if he passed on his knowledge to others—the sacred rituals and healings through nature that, once we forget, are lost forever.

Considering buffalo have huge horns and a grumpy attitude, and can weigh nearly 2000 lbs (900kg), taking them on is no easy task. So while this cub play might look like fun, it’s critical training for adult life when they’ll be helping the pride bring down lunch.

Produced by the European Space Agency for NASA’s Artemis program, the module will supply electricity, water, and oxygen, as well as temperature and course controls. The ESM-3 is at the start of its integration phase, during which equipment, brackets, and harnesses will be added to the structure. An uncrewed Artemis I lunar mission is planned for early summer; the crewed Artemis III mission, planned for 2025, will see the first woman and first person of color setting foot on the moon.

    "description": "Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | Today, July 16, is World Snake Day, so let's pay tribute to their key role in ecosystems everywhere. I've photographed snakes on all continents where they're found, producing two stories for @natgeo in the process. It's tough to single out a favorite species, but the Jameson's mamba, photographed in the rainforest of Cameroon, is a strong contender. Its venom is lethal; unlike other venomous snakes that specialize in just one kind of venom, the Jameson's mamba delivers a particularly nasty cocktail: hemotoxins, cardiotoxins, fasciculins, as well as myotoxic substances. The lethal characteristics of snake venom are what make it so valuable; scientists study the genetic and molecular makeup by collecting venom and DNA samples. This has led to the development of medicines for heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Also, this does not affect the wild populations since all snakes are released after a quick field sampling. Please visit @mattiasklumofficial for more images from our projects around the world.  #mamba #cameroon #protectbiodiversity #conservation @thephotosociety",

While 10 million acres of the corridor are protected, nearly eight million remain threatened by the state’s rapid development and need additional investment to be saved. Ward’s work on the Florida Wildlife Corridor has been funded by @insidenatgeo since 2011, helping lead to the passage of the Florida Wildlife Corridor act in 2021.",

According to critics, the dam appears to limit the seasonal flow from the Omo River to Lake Turkana, putting a vital food source at risk as well as the livelihoods of the people who rely on this ecosystem and reside along the riverbanks. The dam’s construction has been financed mostly by Chinese companies. \n\nPicture 3: An aerial view from Moucha Island in the Gulf of Aden, with cargo ships entering the Red Sea en route to the Suez Canal. Djibouti hosts one of the world's busiest shipping routes, and China established its first overseas military base at this strategic crossroads between Europe and Asia. The base provides logistical support for China’s shipping escort fleet in the gulf (a security and anti-piracy force). \n\nLast image: Traces of the old French railroad near  Metehara, Ethiopia. Seeing an opportunity in the continent's outdated infrastructure, China began investing in Central Africa’s transportation system, targeting areas of logistical interest.",

    "description": "Photo by @beverlyjoubert | It’s hard to comprehend or quantify what we would be losing if Africa’s elephants were to disappear. It’s not just the void that would be left if their irreplaceable ecological role were to go unfulfilled. It’s also just how much poorer our natural world would be in their absence. Their extraordinary intelligence, their memory, their deep sense of family and empathy, their ability to behave and communicate with each other in so many complex ways—elephants enrich our world in ways that we are only beginning to understand and appreciate. Keeping them here is up to us.\n\n#elephants #elephantconservation #wildlife",

    "description": "Photo by @ajistyawan | Last September in Central Java, Indonesia, Timbulsloko villagers in Demak Regency marked the locations of graves with bamboo sticks as part of the process of raising a cemetery by about five feet. They wanted to preserve their connection to the past and the sweet memories of their ancestors for a little while longer. The villagers live with seawater and are surrounded by it, even inside their homes. When they die, they are buried in the land, below sea level.\n\nI live just a few miles from the flood-prone villages, which face rising sea levels and land subsidence. It appeals to my heart to make their story known through \"Sinking Fast\" in National Geographic's July issue.\n\nRead the full story at the link in bio and follow @ajistyawan for more.\n\n#SinkingFast #ClimateChange #RisingSeaLevels #LandSubsidence #Pantura #Demak #CentralJava #Indonesia",

Within the temple, an archaeology team recently discovered more than 2,000 ram mummies (background), along with other animal mummies such as dogs and gazelles, all belonging to the Ptolemaic period (300 B.C.-30 B.C.). \n\nI have true admiration for all the archaeologists and Egyptian workers who have unveiled treasures over the centuries. These workers’ skills and their instincts, together with their deep knowledge—transmitted generation after generation—are unique in the world. Egypt is still full of treasures to discover, and these teams are hard at work to uncover them. Follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.",

    "description": "Video by @joelsartore | Helmeted hornbills are glorious birds—and coveted in the illegal wildlife trade for their solid casques, or helmets. Softer than ivory, they can be carved into beads and statuary. As if sensing the threat, these birds fiercely protect their young: The male helps seal the female inside the cavity of a tree for months, bringing food to her and the chick through a tiny slit. When it’s time for the young to fledge, the hornbills chisel away the seal. A logger who’d heard the birds squawking inside a tree that was cut down brought them to Malaysia’s @penangbirdpark. These hornbills were lucky. Deforestation is a major threat to this species’ survival, and in most cases, birds still sealed inside a tree would die. But this man knew how rare they were and brought them to the bird park. It’s not easy to keep these birds alive when their habitat has disappeared. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark follow me, @joelsartore. #bird #hornbill #helmeted #casque #animal #wildlife #saveourwildlife #video #PhotoArk",

Scientists are studying plants and trees, including lodgepole pines in the area, to determine how forest ecosystems respond after wildfires. When lodgepole pines are burned, their serotinous cones open up and drop to the ground to seed the forest— but if another fire comes before trees mature, they may not grow back. This image was captured while photographing an assignment for the May 2022 issue of National Geographic.

And the task of mothering can be especially challenging for animals of the solitary sort. Unlike lions or wild dogs, leopards have no social safety net, no support in the form of a pack or pride. A leopard mother alone carries the fate of her tiny cub on her shoulders. #leopards #leopardcub #bigcats #bigcatconservation",

    "description": "Video by @joelsartore // Brown-belted bumblebees forage on St. John’s wort, a native plant that’s a vital source of pollen for these amazing pollinators. Because the bees spent just a few seconds on each bloom, I used a special slow-motion camera to show that they actually get a lot done in a short amount of time, gathering the nectar and pollen they need to survive. In the process, they pollinate all along the way, ensuring their host plant’s survival as well. You can do your part by planting a pollinator garden at home, at your office, and by encouraging your local and state governments to make native plants a routine part of any plantings done in parks or roadside areas. We need plants and pollinating insects to help keep the planet healthy, and all of us in the process. // Air Wick® is partnering with World Wildlife Fund to reseed one billion square feet of native wildflowers in the Northern Great Plains.

In the late 20th century, this raptor was on the brink of extinction in the U.S., but populations have since recovered, and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered and threatened species in 1995 and 2007, respectively. These chicks were hatched @suttoncenter as part of the Bald Eagle Recovery Act. #baldeagle #eagle #chicks #raptor #birdofprey #PhotoArk",

In the past 20 years thousands of villagers have moved to higher areas that are safe from the tidal floods.

    "description": "Photo by @amivitale | Giraffe browse in the Singita Grumeti Reserves, a conservatory adjacent to Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. The male giraffe (left) has a snare around his neck. Snares are traps, most often made of wire, set by poachers to catch animals for the illegal bushmeat trade. While many animals caught in snares are consumed for food, others will be left to rot or be so severely wounded that they cannot feed or hunt, drying as a result.\n\nAcross Africa, giraffe populations dropped nearly 40 percent in three decades, a decline thought to be linked to habitat loss and fragmentation as well as poaching, including animals killed by snares. But  giraffe numbers may be rebounding. An analysis of survey data from across the continent suggests the total giraffe population is now around 117,000, approximately 20 percent higher than in 2015, when the last major survey was published. The increase can be attributed to population growth in some areas but also to more accurate census methods.

    "description": "Photo by @stephaniemeiling | Legendary hip-hop artist and Wu-Tang Clan founding member Raekwon (@raekwon) is pictured ahead of his performance at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans during the ESSENCE Festival of Culture.\n\nRaekwon’s passion for music began when he was around 13 years old. He grew up in a neighborhood where everybody loved music and used it as a form of self-expression. “We was running around with radios in our hand, walking up and down the block,” he says. “Didn’t have nowhere to go. And that became our medicine of life.”\n\nReflecting on his career and the moment he realized people identified him as a legend, Raekwon says, “It hit me a long time ago that people really love what I’ve done and what my crew done. But I look at it as a thank you note that made people be like, Yo, you could do it. So to the people giving me that love was like a thank you note to myself.”\n\nOne of the roles music plays in Black culture is helping listeners “get away from the stresses and imperfections in our circumstances,” Raekwon says. “You listen to music, and it just does something to you. It’s almost like music becomes a vitamin inside your mind.”\n\nMusic brings both happiness and joy to the world. On Black joy, Raekwon says, “It’s freedom and having a great spiritual vibe inside of you. It’s feeling like you made it. It’s paying respect to our ancestors.”\n\nThis weekend, National Geographic is capturing Black joy through personal stories and behind-the-scenes moments at the ESSENCE Festival.",

    "description": "Photo by @stephenwilkes | The moon rises over Bears Ears National Monument.\n\nLast year President Joe Biden restored Bears Ears as a national monument, reversing a decision that opened the park for mining and other developments. This also drove five Native American tribes off the land.\n\nEarlier this week, federal officials and tribal nations formally reestablished a commission to oversee land management decisions of Bears Ears’ 1.3 million acres.\n\nI was fortunate to photograph at Bears Ears while on assignment for National Geographic just a few short months ago. I hiked with Navajo guide Louis D. Williams (@louisdwilliams20) and learned about its incredible history. Camping out and photographing the view from the Citadel is magical. Bears Ears is an important and vital U.S. landmark, and I am thankful it’s been restored as a national monument.\n\nTo see more from my travels near and far follow me @stephenwilkes. #bearsears #monument #utah #moon #photography",

Let's see if people receive us.” Questlove thought it would be something fun to do, not knowing the path they would forge that day. “[It] goes to show that when you're living in your heart and with integrity, doors open,” he says. \n\nTheir legacy motivates and inspires them to continue making music, and today they incorporate education and history into their performances. “Even tonight on stage—going through everything from Dixieland to soul music—we have to incorporate everything, like the entire history of Black music, in our set,” Questlove says. “It's not just about The Roots doing our stuff. We have to represent a whole culture when we go on stage, and that's why we do it.” \n\nReflecting on Black joy, Black Thought says, “Because of the days and times that we live in, it’s a form of rebellion, so it's that we celebrate our Blackness in the way that we do and that we embrace it, and that's what we put out there into the world. It makes us disruptors. It makes us rebels, in a sense, but that’s what it is. What the ESSENCE Festival represents traditionally is just the deepest level of that Black joy. It’s people celebrating their Blackness and celebrating Black families and legacy, and it's a beautiful thing.” \n\nThis weekend, National Geographic is capturing Black joy through personal stories and behind-the-scenes moments at the ESSENCE Festival.",

    "description": "Photo by @jasperdoest | A few years ago, a doctoral-student friend in Uganda texted me about villagers working together at night to trap what were actually swarms of bush crickets, which become tasty, protein-filled snacks when salted and fried. I was transfixed by the greenish glow in the photos she texted: a light that people use to attract flocks of insects before dawn. Unfortunately, overharvesting and climate change could threaten this food of the future, and villagers have seen a rapid decrease in the numbers of bush crickets.\n\nTo get the story right, I had to rely on the community. I withheld judgment on the practice and pointed out the economic and nutritional importance of the insect. I came to watch, experience, learn, and connect, as I believe it is through mutual understanding that we can find solutions.\n\nFollow me @jasperdoest for more on the relationship between humankind and nature. #nsenene #uganda #crickets #grasshoppers",

    "description": "Photo and video by @babaktafreshi | More than 4,000 years ago, this landscape in Australia had wild visitors from deep space—a dozen fragments of huge meteorites. The largest body left this 180-meter-wide crater (600 ft). Slide 2 is a video from inside one of the craters during early morning, with ambient bird sounds. The site of the Henbury craters in the Northern Territory was indeed one of the darkest places on Earth that I've observed in many years of night photography. The nearest town is Alice Springs, about 140 kilometers (85 mi) away, and the only \"light dome\" visible was a gentle glow from the south, which soon turned out to be the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy visible to the unaided eye. The southern Milky Way was most spectacular when the galactic center reached high in the sky. The foreground is lit by a few side flashes during the 30-second exposure. #twanight #meteorite #australia #impactcrater",

    "description": "Photo and video by @babaktafreshi | More than 4,000 years ago, this landscape in Australia had wild visitors from deep space—a dozen fragments of huge meteorites. The largest body left this 180-meter-wide crater (600 ft). Slide 2 is a video from inside one of the craters during early morning, with ambient bird sounds. The site of the Henbury craters in the Northern Territory was indeed one of the darkest places on Earth that I've observed in many years of night photography. The nearest town is Alice Springs, about 140 kilometers (85 mi) away, and the only \"light dome\" visible was a gentle glow from the south, which soon turned out to be the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy visible to the unaided eye. The southern Milky Way was most spectacular when the galactic center reached high in the sky. The foreground is lit by a few side flashes during the 30-second exposure. #twanight #meteorite #australia #impactcrater",

The Sawtooth NRA is made up of more than 750,000 acres of protected land, including four wilderness areas and dozens of tall peaks, and offers countless outdoor activities. While on assignment for National Geographic, I got to fly over the Sawtooth mountains at sunset. It made me further appreciate this special place in Idaho and better understand the size of the area, which is about as large as Rhode Island.

Evgenia Arbugaeva, a photographer from the Republic of Sakha in Siberia whose work mainly focuses on the Arctic, reports that Christina’s happiest time is summer, when a state helicopter brings her and other kids home from school to their migrating families.\n\n“So much beauty and power in this photo,” says Quannah Rose Chasinghorse. “This is what being grounded looks like, surrounded by community.”\n\nTo celebrate National Geographic's July cover story, model and activist Quannah Rose Chasinghorse is taking over the @natgeo Instagram account.

As we take in new impressions and experience awe, our busy minds still— all the more so for the photographer who aims to capture a sense of place. While I was working at the Hveravellir hot springs, a little cloud that looked like a flying disc appeared in the sky. This surprising element helped me add atmosphere and magic to the landscape, and it hopefully invites you, the viewer, for a closer look. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images, primarily from Nordic countries. #iceland #landscapephotography #hveravellir",

He and other researchers at the Technical University of Munich are working with Airbus to study how algae might be used to create biofuels at the 1,500-square-foot (more than 16,000 sq ft) site, whose façade is made of special transparent glass that lets ultraviolet light pass through. Via elaborate climate technology and LED lighting, researchers can simulate climate and lighting conditions of any location on Earth to stimulate algal growth cycles. Algae functions as a net carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, so converting them to fuel creates a sustainable energy cycle.

The snake's camouflage obscures its presence, but when a predator draws near—or in this case, a photographer—the rattle is intended to warn them off. The species is widely distributed from Canada to northern Mexico, but changes in its grasslands habitat, such as conversion into agricultural land, account for some of its population decline. Rattlesnakes are vital to controlling rodents and other animals. Follow @javier_aznar_photography for more.",

    "description": "Photos by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | Living root bridges are a wonder of bioengineering. Found in the Khasi Hills of northeast India, these bridges are grown over decades and centuries by local tribes using a Ficus elastica tree. As I walked across these bridges, I realized I couldn't find a comparable experience. It didn’t feel like crossing a concrete bridge and not even like climbing a tree. Instead, it felt as if a fairy tale had come to life. And in a way, that’s what it is.\n\nIn a place where concrete bridges do not survive even a few decades because of constant rains, landslides, earthquakes, and floods, living root bridges grow stronger, more robust, and resilient with age. They do not require revenue to build, only time. Also, these root bridges don’t just support and connect humans who cross over them. Studies show that a single F. elastica tree potentially supports a few hundred living species, including  insects, birds, sometimes mammals, and even vegetation like moss. These root bridges are not just individuals but ecosystems, constantly interacting with their living and nonliving surroundings. Follow me @prasen.yadav for more photos from the biodiverse states of India.",

However a recent study highlights a different kind of conversation: the gentle whispers between a mother and her calf. Intimate grunts and little squeaks of a baby humpback whales can only be heard by its mum; they whisper to each other so they aren’t overheard by something dangerous. These gentle and aware creatures can be incredibly accepting of our presence in their own vulnerable environment.",

It was the project that started my photography career.\n\nOn the walk, I went to prom, won second place in a hog-calling contest, ran out of water in the desert, slept in an open jail cell, got blisters three layers deep, almost got hit by more trucks than I can count, loitered a lot, and got really good at playing a children’s electric guitar.\n\nThe first thousand miles were marked by extreme physical pain, as I whittled my untrained body and mind into shape. I kept thinking that the place I needed to be was somewhere other than the present moment, step, or conversation. Over time, this desire to be anywhere but in the present broke away.\n\nThe middle 1,500 miles was a space of opening like I’ve never experienced in my life—a time marked by letting go of everything. The pain went away, and all the doors seemed to open as I walked ten 30-mile days in a row out of Santa Fe, feeling unstoppable on the road.\n\nWith 900 miles left, I stopped in Bloomington, Indiana, and rested for three days. I sat down with a map and charted what I believed would be the end of the walk. When I saw that end on the map, it felt like it was over. I already knew I could do it; I’d already done it. That last 900 miles started to hurt again as I looked too far ahead. I had to make each day about the people I met and go deeper into those conversations.\n\nEventually I arrived in NYC, where friends met me at Battery Park, playing \"Riders on the Storm.\" It felt incredibly anticlimactic, because there was no \"there,” no grand finish line. The end of the walk didn’t feel like the end at all, and so the walk just keeps going ...still. To learn more and read journal entries from that time, follow @argonautphoto.",

    "description": "Photos by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | Twenty years ago, I was walking across America, from Encinitas, California, to New York City—3,349 miles (5,389 km) in 154 days. I had no cell phone and no support crew. Just me, my dog, Cosmo, a camera, and a wagon filled with supplies. It was the project that started my photography career.\n\nOn the walk, I went to prom, won second place in a hog-calling contest, ran out of water in the desert, slept in an open jail cell, got blisters three layers deep, almost got hit by more trucks than I can count, loitered a lot, and got really good at playing a children’s electric guitar.\n\nThe first thousand miles were marked by extreme physical pain, as I whittled my untrained body and mind into shape. I kept thinking that the place I needed to be was somewhere other than the present moment, step, or conversation. Over time, this desire to be anywhere but in the present broke away.\n\nThe middle 1,500 miles was a space of opening like I’ve never experienced in my life—a time marked by letting go of everything. The pain went away, and all the doors seemed to open as I walked ten 30-mile days in a row out of Santa Fe, feeling unstoppable on the road.\n\nWith 900 miles left, I stopped in Bloomington, Indiana, and rested for three days. I sat down with a map and charted what I believed would be the end of the walk. When I saw that end on the map, it felt like it was over. I already knew I could do it; I’d already done it. That last 900 miles started to hurt again as I looked too far ahead. I had to make each day about the people I met and go deeper into those conversations.\n\nEventually I arrived in NYC, where friends met me at Battery Park, playing \"Riders on the Storm.\" It felt incredibly anticlimactic, because there was no \"there,” no grand finish line. The end of the walk didn’t feel like the end at all, and so the walk just keeps going ...still. To learn more and read journal entries from that time, follow @argonautphoto.",

    "description": "Photos by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | Twenty years ago I was walking across America, from Encinitas, California, to New York City—3,349 miles (5,389 km)  in 154 days. I had no cell phone and no support crew. Just me, my dog Cosmo, a camera, and a wagon filled with supplies. It was the project that started my photography career. \n\nWhy did I do it? I wanted a journey so big that I couldn’t see the end. Without an end in sight, the world became very simple. I had only to walk, eat, sleep, and talk to the strangers I met along the way.\n\nI couldn't have done it without Cosmo. She was a year and a half old when we started the walk, and a natural sled dog: a husky/malamute/wolf mix. Because of her, I was never afraid to sleep in a refrigerator box or behind a dumpster, outside gas stations, or in the weeds on the side of the road. I’d initially thought about walking with a pack llama but then people told me they get lonely and I’d need two. I looked into a camel, and as you could imagine that was complicated. \n\nEventually I settled on the idea of a massive dog and looked at many options for my trip companion. The big dogs aren’t really meant for mileage, though—except for sled dogs. At the husky rescue in Fort Collins, Colorado, Cosmo was the biggest and prettiest and ran straight for me—and tackled me. That sealed the deal. \n\nDuring the walk I helped pull the cart up hills with pole extensions, and to protect her feet, Cosmo wore duct-tape boots after the fancy ones wore out on day two (they were lined so they didn’t stick to her). While I got terrible blisters, Cosmo had very few foot problems. To learn more about the walk and Cosmo and read journal entries, follow @argonautphoto.",

    "description": "Photos by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | Twenty years ago I was walking across America, from Encinitas, California, to New York City—3,349 miles (5,389 km)  in 154 days. I had no cell phone and no support crew. Just me, my dog Cosmo, a camera, and a wagon filled with supplies. It was the project that started my photography career. \n\nWhy did I do it? I wanted a journey so big that I couldn’t see the end. Without an end in sight, the world became very simple. I had only to walk, eat, sleep, and talk to the strangers I met along the way.\n\nI couldn't have done it without Cosmo. She was a year and a half old when we started the walk, and a natural sled dog: a husky/malamute/wolf mix. Because of her, I was never afraid to sleep in a refrigerator box or behind a dumpster, outside gas stations, or in the weeds on the side of the road. I’d initially thought about walking with a pack llama but then people told me they get lonely and I’d need two. I looked into a camel, and as you could imagine that was complicated. \n\nEventually I settled on the idea of a massive dog and looked at many options for my trip companion. The big dogs aren’t really meant for mileage, though—except for sled dogs. At the husky rescue in Fort Collins, Colorado, Cosmo was the biggest and prettiest and ran straight for me—and tackled me. That sealed the deal. \n\nDuring the walk I helped pull the cart up hills with pole extensions, and to protect her feet, Cosmo wore duct-tape boots after the fancy ones wore out on day two (they were lined so they didn’t stick to her). While I got terrible blisters, Cosmo had very few foot problems. To learn more about the walk and Cosmo and read journal entries, follow @argonautphoto.",

Male lions have a reputation of being lazy, as they often rely on females to hunt; less known, however, is that they scavenge a lot of their food from hyenas—very efficient hunters. Male lions rarely hold prides alone; they usually form bonds, often with related males, to work together to protect the groups of females and their cubs within their territory.",

Prompted by food shortages and congested fishing areas, fishers developed the practice during World War II as they adapted to a changing environment. \n\nAt least half of Earth’s oxygen comes from organisms in the ocean. That’s right—more than half of the oxygen you breathe comes from marine plants, such as phytoplankton and seaweed, that engage in photosynthesis. That is, they use carbon dioxide, water, and energy from the sun to make food for themselves, releasing oxygen in the process. In other words, they photosynthesize. And they do it in the ocean. Think about that for a moment. It means at least every second breath each one of us takes comes from our beautiful oceans. Today, take a deep breath and feel that connection. We need to protect them, so we can breathe! \n\nSupport an ocean organization near you, or learn more from some of these inspirational ocean advocates: @oceanswellorg @localoceanco @dr.sylviaearle @brianskerry @Sealegacy. #oceans #srilanka #fishing",

During the pandemic, Guðmundsdóttir had cherished the extra time she had with her two teenage daughters and decided to have another child. “I think that was the tipping point for me,” she says. “I realized I wasn’t ready to be done with the mom thing.”\n\nWith a staggering 16.5 percent increase in births during the second quarter of 2021, Iceland has been in the midst of a pandemic baby boom. A leading hypothesis on why this might be is that in times of economic uncertainty, the Nordic country’s generous family-leave pay helps alleviate concerns about increased financial burden. A new baby can be a safety net.\n\nAll five Nordic countries offer paid parental leave for at least 11 months, based on income from the previous year. Payouts range from about 53 percent income in Denmark to nearly 100 percent—and as much as $6,000 a month—in Norway. In Iceland new parents receive 12 months paid leave at 80 percent income, up to about $4,500 a month.",

    "description": "Photo by @johnstanmeyer | In Jordan, I walked through this windswept valley, Wadi Hafeer, with Salmeh. We chatted, Salmeh in broken English, me in ruinous Arabic, mostly listening to the silence and the bleats of his goats. Petroglyphs were carved here 8,000 years earlier. Our ancestors began to walk through this valley (wadi) some 60,000 years ago. In many ways, we are hardly different from when we started that human migration from lands further south, in what today we call the Horn of Africa. Our primary distinction is the borders we've created since, dividing us. As we neared his encampment of his Bedouin family, Salmeh's wife called out. He stopped briefly to listen, but the moving herd was too loud. At that moment in this natural cathedral, as the sun spread near-shadowless light inside the ravine and worn hills, I felt timeless along the highway of our human existence. From the @outofedenwalk article series. To see more of my work, please follow @johnstanmeyer. #jordan #WadiHafeer #wadi #ravine #valley #goats",

Stealthier, faster, and lithe on their feet, the females of the pride are the real stars here … and success so often hinges on their skills, experience, and carefully coordinated maneuverings. #lions #bigcats #bigcatsofinstagram",

Rolls-Royce is one of the biggest suppliers of civil turbofans in the world, so there’s a good chance you've flown on a plane powered by one of them. On the company’s production line, every single detail in the construction of an engine is double-checked by machines—and humans. Many pieces are, in fact, manually assembled.\n\nHere, a massive Trent 1000 development engine is being moved from the prep shop to Testbed 80, where the piece will be tested and inspected.

    "description": "Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | The snow leopard evolved to live in the high-elevation desert of India's Himalayan range, and every part of its body shows signs of these unique adaptations. The nose has its own story. Large nostrils and a broad nasal cavity make it easier to inhale large amounts of oxygen-poor mountain air. The nasal cavity houses particularly large and thick mazes of bone and tissue called turbinates. When a snow leopard inhales freezing air into the turbinates, it gets heated as it mixes with warm air exiting the lungs. Now that's an incredible life hack that evolution has provided to these big cats. Follow me @prasen.yadav for more photos from India.",

I photographed this small cuttlefish—it was only about an inch (2.5 cm) long—on a night dive off the coast of West Papua, Indonesia. As with many boldly colored critters such as caterpillars or nudibranchs, this cuttlefish is highly poisonous and advertises its toxicity with a bright pattern. One of the things I like the most about exploring the marine realm is the otherworldly life that call it home. I encountered this cuttlefish toward the end of the dive. I spent as much time as I could photographing it but eventually had to surface because I was running out of air. I’ve never seen another one since. Follow me @timlaman as I celebrate the incredible biodiversity of our planet. #cuttlefish #underwater #coralreefs #indonesia #westpapua",

The north coast of Java is sinking, and the sea is rising. While global warming is raising sea levels worldwide by around an eighth of an inch a year, the land here is sinking as much as four inches. People try as hard as they can to keep their land and their history above water.\n\nI live just a few miles from the flood-prone villages, which face rising sea levels and land subsidence.

These trees can live for well over 4,000 years, the oldest being an estimated 4,853 years old. The tree pictured here is perched high in the mountains of Nevada’s Great Basin National Park and is surrounded by stunning 360-degree views of a seemingly endless landscape. These wide-open wilderness areas always make me feel like a kid again, as they bring to life the magic of the outdoors. // This is Nevada—awe-inspiring, otherworldly, and gloriously unspoiled.

    "description": "Video by @amivitale | Happy World Giraffe Day! The longest day in the year is marked for the world’s tallest animal. Here at @sararafoundation, I am greeted by Fupi (Shorty in Swahili). The reticulated giraffe was successfully rescued and rehabilitated by Sarara’s team. The “horns” on top of his head, called ossicones, are bony projections made from ossified cartilage. While found on both male and female giraffes, ossicones are used by males in combat. In some species, males even grow extras to give them additional advantage. \n\nAcross Africa, giraffes are undergoing what is being called a silent extinction. Populations have dropped nearly 40 percent in three decades, and the reticulated giraffe, one of the four species, numbers fewer than 16,000. The decline is thought to be caused by habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching, but lack of long-term conservation efforts in the past makes it hard to know exactly why. Scientists are now pursuing major studies to understand why giraffes are disappearing and what can be done about it. \n\nFollow and support @r.e.s.c.u.e and @sararafoundation to help save this wondrous creature and @amivitale for more stories. #protectgiraffes #DontLetThemDisappear #giraffe #savegiraffes #kenya #worldgiraffeday",

    "description": "Photo by @janetjarman | Traditional midwife Lucia Girón Pérez, at left, greets her neighbor Elena Girón Guzman while walking home after seeing a pregnant woman under her care in Tzajalchén, a Tzeltal-speaking community in Chiapas, Mexico. Both women carry medicinal plants, used throughout the region for healing. During the pandemic, midwives in Chiapas have been on the birthing front lines, especially in remote areas, despite receiving little support from local health-care authorities. As COVID-19 spread throughout the region, women began to fear hospital safety even more than before. As a result, Girón Pérez’s workload spiked, and she started handling two to three births a day. Girón Pérez attended 346 births in 2020, 403 in 2021, and more than 125 so far this year in the two-room birthing space she and her husband built beside their home. Her dream is to expand this area to include a private waiting room and kitchen for families who need lodging.

    "description": "Photos by Muhammed Muheisen @mmuheisen | In March I spent three weeks at the border of Romania and Ukraine to document some of the stories of the people who fled the war in Ukraine. \n\nSeen here: Yulia, a Ukrainian refugee, comforts her daughter, Katya; three-year-old refugee, Andriy; refugees wait to board a train; Diana, a four-year-old, sits in a bus with her mother; and last, a photograph with the name \"Mia\" written on it was left by a tent near the border.\n\nBehind the word \"refugees\" are people—forced to leave their homes and hopes, their families and memories, in search of a new, safe home. Behind the word \"refugees\" are mothers and fathers, grandparents and grandchildren. Nobody leaves their home unless they're forced to—that's what I try to show in my images. \n\nDuring these weeks, I was humbled to join a team from the Everyday Refugees Foundation to give a hand to people fleeing the war. For more photos of the refugee crisis, follow me @mmuheisen @mmuheisenpublic.

She consults a Magic 8 Ball with her granddaughters, Aya and Michelle.\n\nPhotographed for the Clayton Sisterhood Project, I documented my woman-majority family’s next generation of mothers and daughters as a way of creating our own archive. I often return to the Swahili term and Kwanzaa principle of Kujichagulia (Self-Determination) and its focus on building identity both as a person and as a community, both historically and in the present day. It raises the question “Who am I?” I am made of my ancestors, my past and present moments, my community, and my neighborhood. Chronicling Black life for future generations, the intention for this project, meant not only visualizing the tenderness in my family’s gatherings but also utilizing the universal language of photography to record moments of rest, leisure, and joy in Black women and girl’s traditions at home and in play.\n\nOn this Juneteenth, National Geographic is highlighting Black creators who have chronicled the experiences that nourish their communities.

This young male—tracked via a radio collar fitted by the team at the Cook County Urban Coyote Research Project, led by Dr. Stanley Gehrt—found his way to a small green strip near downtown and settled with a mate in one of the few areas not already claimed by existing packs. (That’s the former Sears Tower in the background!) After the first flash of lights from the camera trap, the coyotes were wary to walk by again. I left this camera set up for four months before finally getting this shot, but sadly after this photo was made, the coyote was found dead, apparently hit by a car. Life in the big city for urban coyotes is often short-lived.

    "description": "Photo by @renan_ozturk | Words by Mark Synnott: I didn’t want to say anything until we were officially underway—for fear of jinxing what I hope will be the trip of a lifetime—but since we just left the dock at Rumery’s Boat Yard in Biddeford, Maine, I think it’s time to say a few words about the voyage.\n\nIn some respects our goal is straightforward: To sail my Stevens 47 from Maine to Alaska via the Northwest Passage. But @Renan_ozturk and I are also #OnAssignment for @natgeo to re-trace the Franklin expedition, which disappeared in the Northwest Passage in the late 1840s.\n\nStay tuned for future reports. For now we're heading into the Gulf of Maine en route to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Follow @renan_ozturk for more photos from the field. #ThePolarSunExpedition #Sailing",

    "description": "Video by @kiliiiyuyan | Greenland huskies are an amazing working-dog breed. They’re so important to Greenlanders that they’re the only dogs allowed above the Arctic Circle. Up here in the town of Qaanaaq, almost all transportation is by dogsled. The animals remain only partly domesticated. As adults, they can be dangerous, but as puppies, they roam the villages freely, full of curiosity about visiting Nat Geo photographers. While on assignment here in North Greenland, I spent downtime away from the sea ice playing with the pups all about town. #Greenland #huskies",

    "description": "Photos by @balazsgardi | This week I followed a team of archaeologists recovering the remains of a 17th-century shipwreck from a sea cave along the rugged shoreline of the Oregon coast.\n\nSupported by law officers and search-and-rescue personnel, we crawled over slippery boulders and waded through tide pools to pry free and float out timbers that once belonged to a Spanish galleon locally known for centuries as the legendary Beeswax Wreck.\n\nThe Santo Cristo de Burgos was carrying silk and beeswax between the Spanish colonies of the Philippines and Mexico when it veered off course and wrecked in the winter of 1693. Its remains were spread far and wide by a tsunami that followed a massive earthquake in 1700.\n\nRead the full story at the link in bio and follow @balazsgardi for more.",

She has dealt with transphobia and housing and economic hardship. From the West Coast to the East Coast to the South, where she briefly lived with a Honduran man she met online, Kataleya has strived to find stability.

These waters are rich in phytoplankton, which in turn supports marine life, from a process known as upwelling. This phenomenon occurs when colder, nutrient-rich water from the depths is lifted closer to the surface by winds, replacing warmer, depleted water. Upwelling peaks in spring and summer along the California Current with the seasonal intensity of northwesterly winds. To see more of this beautiful part of the planet, please visit @ladzinski.",

    "description": "Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | In central Spain, a species known as a little owl feeds on a katydid at sunrise, when the spring and summer temperatures are still low and the owls are more active. Little owls feed primarily on insects like beetles and grasshoppers as well as bigger prey such as rodents, reptiles, and amphibians. They're one of the best allies for farmers, helping to keep pests under control. Unfortunately the use of insecticides has decimated the populations of many species, including little owls. The lack of prey and nesting sites are other threats, mainly due to the rise of industrialized agriculture. Follow @javier_aznar_photography for more images about little owls  #athene noctua #owls #castillalamancha",

Moonlight was softly shining on this otherworldly landscape, creating enough light to reveal details with just a 10-second exposure. Orion the Hunter, rising high in the sky, seemed to lead a troop of bentonite beings. The largest formations in the view are 10 feet (3 meters) tall. I have photographed numerous natural landmarks at night, and those in Nevada’s Cathedral Gorge State Park have made for some remarkable memories. The eroded soft clay is the exposed bed of an ancient lake. // This is Nevada—awe-inspiring, otherworldly, and gloriously unspoiled.

    "description": "Photos by @janetjarman | I feel grateful to the many people who made this story about traditional Maya midwives come to life, especially the women in Guatemala and Mexico who shared very intimate moments with me. One of them, midwife Epifania Elías Gonzales, invited me to witness the birth process of Delfina Vicente López, who was eager to deliver her baby in the comfort of her own home, surrounded by family, with Elías by her side. Photo 1: Christian Ixmay Pérez brings Elías to his family’s home in Aldea Nuevo San Antonio, Guatemala, just after his mother, Vicente, went into labor. Photo 2: Elías examines Vicente at her home, not far from San Carlos Sija, Guatemala. During her 30-year career, Elías has attended the births of hundreds of women in the predominantly K’iche'-speaking Indigenous region, where women customarily give birth at home. Photo 3: During a ceremony at her home altar, Vicente (center), her family, and a charismatic Catholic priest pray to bring on the birth of her son. Photo 4: Clementa Eluvia Monterroso Romero, 69 (at left), and Josefa Monterroso Romero, 70, walk to their local health clinic in La Victoria, Guatemala.\n\nRead the full story at the link in bio. #midwife #maternalhealth #birth #Guatemala #Mexico",

One of my favorite things to do when I need to recharge is head to the mountains of North Carolina. I’ve been doing it for years, first with my father, then with my wife and children. This particular evening a clearing storm left both valley fog and the Milky Way visible from the Cherohala Skyway. The Skyway runs through the Unicoi Mountains, and when a storm clears those mountains the view is phenomenal. Experiencing sights like this leaves me filled with wonder at the beauty of the world. // This National Get Outdoors Day, @visitnc and experience firsts that turn into moments you'll never forget.

The population on Mendol is small. Very small. Google \"Mendol Island,\" and you'll discover the only mention is a rice mill, with a photograph of a shed that looks to be from the '40s or '50s. It's as if Mendol doesn't exist. I was told to visit the pool hall in Teluk Dalam. That afternoon I spent a few hours in this hall, as milky-green light poured in on the few tables, occupied continuously with serious players. Instead of enduring another disgraceful loss (I enjoy billiards, but I'm terrible at it), I drank coffee and talked to men who were laborers on nearby islands or farm their land. Everyone was kind—the beauty of Indonesian culture—and extremely welcoming. There was an energy of desperation, though, as if everyone was waiting to go somewhere else, to do something more. To see more of my work, please follow @johnstanmeyer. #indonesia #riau #mendol #island #billiards #pool #poolhall #billiardhall",

Every spring, more than 40,000 people make the trek to the Hinglaj temple to honor the goddess Sati and cleanse their sins through a series of rituals—the largest Hindu pilgrimage in the nation, which has a Muslim majority. First image: Near the edge of the volcano's crater, a pilgrim touches a poster representing Shiva. Next, a boy holds a coconut offering that will be thrown into the crater—to thank the gods and grant wishes. Third: a night view of Chandragup Volcano.

    "description": "Photos by Pete McBride @pedromcbride | Gliding Among Gentle Giants: The giant manta rays in the Revillagigedo archipelago, a biosphere reserve known as the “Galapagos of Mexico,” have the largest brain-to-size ratio of any cold-blooded fish and are some of the most magnificent creatures I’ve had the pleasure to swim with.\n\nLocated some 540 kilometers (330 mi) south of Baja California, the waters surrounding the four volcanic islands of the archipelago contain some of the largest aggregations of sharks and manta rays in the world, as well as tuna, humpback whales, and five species of sea turtles.\n\nSince 1994, six nautical miles around the islands have been protected, creating a natural, vibrant habitat that is a rare model in today’s troubled oceans.

    "description": "Photo by @johnstanmeyer | Volcano spirituality is connected to all aspects of Indonesia’s culture and faiths. While researching the subject for a National Geographic article, I spoke with anthropologists, shamans, and local Balinese journalists, including my friend and assistant Tilik Wayan, whose father was a bit of a mystic himself. I learned about the temple on Mount Agung, in Bali’s Besakih village. The Balinese believe that spirits reside in this volcano.\n\nDuring a Melasti (purification) ceremony on Petitenget Beach, participants turn their backs to Agung—the most sacred active volcano on Bali—and enter into a trance. Some press with all their might a sharp dagger into their chests (sometimes their heads). Having lived in Bali for more than five years, I've witnessed many trances involving daggers and never saw anyone puncture skin. It’s considered a blessing to go so deep into a trance, a level of spirituality not to be feared. To see more of my work, please follow @johnstanmeyer. #bali #indonesia #Petitenget #melasti #trance #dagger #IslandOfTheSpirits #stanmeyerinbali #VolcanoGods",

    "description": "Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Watching elephants go about their lumbering business as the sun dips beneath the horizon, you may begin to wonder: When and how do these iconic giants sleep? The truth is that the pachyderm life leaves little time for snoozing. In the wild, it takes almost constant foraging to keep those supersized bodies fed with a plant-based diet—as much as 300 kilograms (660 lb) daily for a large adult. And then there’s the vigilance required when you live side by side with large predators; they may have few natural enemies, but caution is still critical. All of this means most elephants sleep for only a couple of hours at a time, and entirely sleepless days and nights are not uncommon. What’s more, unlike us humans, elephants pay little heed to sunset and sunrise when deciding on bedtime. #elephants #elephantsofinstagram #wildlife",
