       "  'description': 'Photo by Corey Arnold @arni_coraldo | San Francisco was the focus of the raccoon portion of my article on urban wildlife, but on most nights during my quest, a coyote seemed to show up and steal the show. This coyote is letting out a defensive warning—a howl toward the presence of a pre-dawn dog walker nearby. Coyotes often feast on rodents and other natural foods found in parks, empty lots, and overgrown green spaces. But there are conflicting opinions about whether coyotes should be allowed to populate dense urban spaces. Pets such as cats and small dogs have increasingly been targeted as the coyotes expand across the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Maasai people are an Indigenous ethnic group in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania who maintain their way of life, despite government programs encouraging them to give up their seminomadic lifestyle. The Maasai’s traditional survival skills—such as the ability to produce food in dry, arid lands—offer strategies for adapting to environments altered by climate change, an Oxford study has found.

       "  'description': 'Photos by @erintrieb | Zahra traveled to the U.S. on a Fulbright scholarship August 9, 2021, just one week before Kabul and the whole of Afghanistan would fall to the Taliban. She feared for the safety of her friends and family. She knew that the Taliban regime not only forbade Afghan women from participating in sports but also historically had targeted Afghanistan’s Hazara ethnic minority population.\\n\\nZahra was introduced to long-distance running in Afghanistan, where she joined Free to Run, a nonprofit that empowers women and girls around the world through sport. She went on to finish three marathons there and competed in a Half Ironman in Dubai in February 2020.\\n\\nLast year, Zahra ran the 50th TCS New York City Marathon in 4:59:41. It was her personal best marathon time by 10 minutes. She finished 6,826th of 11,350 women. She was the only runner from Afghanistan.\\n\\n“Whenever I feel like I can’t run any farther, I think about all the girls and women who cannot run in Afghanistan, who cannot get an education, who cannot go to work,” says Zahra, who is Hazara. “Their problems are bigger than mine, and when I remember them, it motivates me to keep going, to do whatever I can for Afghan women and my family. The women in Afghanistan are the main source of my inspiration. I keep praying for them, and it is for them that I run.”\\n\\n(1) Zahra goes for a short trail run near her college’s campus in New Hampshire in preparation for last year’s New York City Marathon. (2) A collection of her athletic medals at her home. (3) On the train to New York City. (4) Taking in the sights at Times Square. (5) Stretching in the VIP tent before the start of the race. (6) A view of the 2021 marathon with the city’s skyline in the background. (7, 8) A sense of relief and accomplishment after receiving her medal.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by @estherhorvath | My portrait series on women in Arctic science focuses on climate researchers and explorers who work in one of the world’s most challenging environments: Ny-Ålesund, in Norway\\'s Svalbard archipelago—the northernmost community in the world that\\'s home to a diverse group of scientists. I capture my subjects in the magical atmosphere of a place connected to their work—and in this case, their dreams. \\n\\nKatie Sipes, a postdoctoral researcher, dressed as her favorite movie character, Frozen\\'s Elsa. She took this costume with her on a permafrost expedition because she had dreamed of somehow finding an occasion to wear it in the far reaches of Norway, which inspired the film\\'s fictional kingdom. With this portrait, she now had the chance. Sipes identifies with the character\\'s call to forge her own path, and the idea, she says, that “strong females don’t need a prince.”\\n\\nHer mission is to study Arctic ecosystems and the organisms that rely on them, she says, \"allowing humans to better understand the magnitude and incredible diversity that lives on our own planet.\" And knowing this extreme environment better might prime us to better understand other planets, she adds. She\\'s drawn by a sense of urgency: \"This endangered ecosystem is on the cusp of being lost forever. The purity of the Arctic amplifies the desire to preserve and study all of its hidden secrets that might change our world.” Follow me @estherhorvath for more polar science stories.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Iconic predators like lions need space to roam. And space is running out. What remains of suitable lion habitat is under threat from human encroachment, climate change, and degradation. Without wilderness, lion numbers—and the numbers of so many other species—will continue to diminish. A new assessment by the World Wildlife Fund warns that across the globe, populations of vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish) have declined by 69% on average since 1970, with habitat destruction as a leading cause in all regions. To stem and reverse these losses, we need to focus our will and energy on preserving and protecting habitats—in short, we need to make room for wildlife. \\n#lions #lionconservation #bigcatconservation #lioncubs',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photos by @anandavarma // Just after sunset, the tide begins to recede along the shore at Salt Creek Recreation Area, near Port Angeles, Washington. The landscape is stunning, but you can only experience the true magic of this place by exploring the rocky shoreline up close. As you approach the tide pools, you will first notice the larger animals, such as anemones, crabs, and mussels. But look closer, and you’ll see the hidden layers of beauty in this place. My favorite discoveries here were the pink-tipped tentacles of the aggregating anemone, the armored texture of gooseneck barnacles, and the eyeballs of baby prickleback fish getting ready to hatch out of their eggs. // The #MazdaCX50 is purpose-built to connect you with nature. After all, it’s on unpaved dirt and gravel paths where our sense of wonder comes alive. The first-ever Mazda CX-50. We’re more human in nature.',\n",

With the rats, we find that it is positive social experience, rather than biological identity, that strengthens compassionate actions.”\\n\\nIn the lab, Dr. Bartal and her team tested what the rodents do when they see another rat trapped inside a tube for an hour. The free rat senses the trapped rat’s distress and is motivated to help by opening the door and releasing the trapped rat. This behavior suggests that rats are not only affected by others’ distress but also motivated to act for the benefit of others and their well-being. Interestingly, Bartal’s team also found that adult rats help only those belonging to their own social group, while adolescent rats don’t discriminate. This suggests that the bias to help others of their own kind emerges in adulthood.\\n\\nBartal’s study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at Tel Aviv University.

       "  'description': \"Photo by @joelsartore | Meet Bin, an endangered northern yellow-cheeked gibbon, photographed @eprc.vietnam. Gibbons like Bin are exclusively arboreal, meaning they spend almost all their time in trees, trying to avoid touching their feet to the ground. While this might seem impossible, it's actually quite easy for gibbons thanks to their extra-long arms. This species uses those lanky forelimbs for brachiation—a form of movement in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms.

Most followers know me for my images of the night sky, but this post is my tribute to millions of women in Iran who fight for freedom. Mahsa Amini, 22, was visiting family in Tehran in mid-September when she was arrested for an \"improper hijab\" (head covering) while riding inside her brother\\'s car. She died several days later, sparking national protests. Amini had suffered multiple blows to the head, according to London-based broadcaster Iran International. \\n\\nI was born in Iran in 1978 and lived there for 33 years. During that time, I witnessed women living in daily fear of the hijab police. What is less known to the outside world is that Iranian society appears to be becoming more secular, though strict hijab enforcement is still a focus of the country\\'s leaders. Meanwhile protests continue across the country despite severe crackdowns.',\n",

Roughly twice a year, the mobile clinic travels the country’s Baikal–Amur Magistral railway line, which crosses Siberia to the Russian Far East for more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), and stops at villages along the way to provide medical care to residents. Named after Matvei Yakovlevich Mudrov, a 19th-century physician who helped establish clinical practice in Russia, the train is operated by the state-owned Russian Railways and employs around 15 doctors who offer specialized services, including x-ray, ultrasound, neurology, and ophthalmology. For many communities along the rail line, the Matvei Mudrov represents a rare connection to the rest of the country.

       "  'description': 'Photo by @kaigner (Karine Aigner) // We met online. Her picture popped up in a pet finder ad. My Thanksgiving plans had been canceled, and I decided to go for a two-hour drive. “Just to see,” I told myself. When I walked in the room, she beelined toward me like we knew each other. Kali came home that night. What I didn’t know was that she’d spent the first year of her life in a crate in shelters, had never had a family, couldn’t walk on a leash, was scared of everything, and didn’t for one second consider herself a dog. The lost soul soon showed her true spirit in the big city, where she quickly adapted. She was smart and eager. We learned about each other—and became inseparable. In time, Kali overcame her fear of life, learned to trust, and blossomed. She soon walked the streets as if she owned them, accompanying me to restaurants, bars, and any place that would let her in. She lived for our morning runs in the forest. She’s my sidekick and best friend. The bond between us runs deep. Today, Kali comes everywhere—rock climbing, hiking, camping, road trips, and the supermarket. She is a master adventurer, always up for anything, and always up for a fantastic view at the edge of the Chama River in New Mexico. Shelter dogs are special beings. Never pass one up—they are forever grateful, and you’ll have a forever friend. // In honor of National Make A Dog’s Day today, help us celebrate our furry friends by participating in the @natgeoyourshot #MakeADogsDay Challenge! Head to the pinned post on @natgeoyourshot to learn more. // Subaru and its retailers are proud to celebrate their 4th annual National #MakeADogsDay on Oct. 22.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by @joelsartore | Found on every continent except Antarctica and South America, moles like this eastern mole @newildliferehab in Nebraska are often seen as garden pests because of their intricate underground tunnel systems. While their tunneling behavior may label moles as a backyard nuisance, they actually play a beneficial role in soil management and controlling the population of undesirable grubs and insects. By moving earth, moles facilitate better aeration of the soil and enable organic matter to travel deeper. Their tunneling also allows subsoil material to be moved closer to the surface, where nutrients may be more available to plant roots.

       "  'description': 'Photo by Mattias A. Klum @mattiasklumofficial | A Galápagos land iguana has a favorite spiny meal on Isabela Island. Since freshwater is scarce on the Galápagos Islands, this gorgeous lizard obtains most of its moisture from the prickly pear that makes up a large proportion of its diet. It’s estimated that between 5,500 and 9,500 land iguanas are found in the Galápagos. On Santiago Island, when it was previously called King James Island, they were so abundant that naturalist Charles Darwin had remarked, “When we were left at James, we could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to pitch our single tent.” In the years since, entire populations (including all the animals on Santiago Island) have been wiped out by introduced feral animals, such as goats, cats, and pigs.

       "  'description': \"Photo by Michaela Skovranova @mishkusk | Adult Adélie  penguins will swim anywhere between 5 to 120 kilometers (3 to 75 mi) offshore from their breeding sites to catch food for their young. Their diets may vary by location but mostly consist of fish and krill. They're capable of diving to depths of up to 175 meters (575 ft), though they usually feed within the first 70 meters (230 ft)—an incredibly impressive feat. Once they enter the ocean, they also face predators such as leopard seals and killer whales. Fortunately, they're efficient swimmers, and they'll swim in groups to reduce their own chances of becoming a meal. \\n#Wildlife #Penguin #Antarctica #Ocean #AdéliePenguin\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by @katieorlinsky // This is my three-year-old dog Goose chasing sticks in the Red Hook Channel, New York. My partner and I live between Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia, and three years ago we adopted Goose from a Virginia shelter. They had rented out an empty storefront and filled it with adorable, adoptable puppies, all of which thankfully found loving homes. One of those pups was a chubby little three-month-old hound mix with dirt on his nose, spots on his ears, and soulful eyes. He slept on my lap the whole car ride home. He remained a sleepy, snuggly puppy for about 24 more hours, and then it was go time! Goose loves action, whatever it may be—playing with other dogs, fetch, running. Most of all, he loves it when all of these things can happen in water. Goose loves to swim, but he wasn’t always so comfortable in water. We first tried to teach him to swim in a pool, but he couldn't figure out the stairs. We had to carry him in. Then he couldn’t get enough. Lakes, streams, even the ocean—Goose goes right in! Watching him swim still makes me feel super proud and inspires me to be brave and overcome my own fears. // Dogs make the world a better place.

Researchers have found that the close bonds these orphans forge with one another help defray the stress of being separated from their mothers and herds. Young orphaned elephants living with peers or other family members, such as aunts, cousins, or siblings, had stress hormone levels comparable to young elephants living with their mothers.

And yet the wilderness that stands to be explored and ruled over by these top predators shrinks with every passing year. Africa’s lions have been eradicated from 90% of their historic range due to poaching, habitat loss, and conflict with humans. In the pockets of sub-Saharan Africa where they still maintain strongholds, their future is increasingly uncertain. Protecting and expanding space for lions to roam safely has been at the heart of my conservation work for decades. It’s simply impossible to imagine an Africa without them. \\n#lions #bigcatconservation #wildlife #bigcatsofinstagram',\n",

Snow leopards scrape their back legs in loose soil, leaving a small depression with a mound of soil adjacent. Along with field researchers of @snowleopardtrust, I scouted the Himalaya mountains looking for  locations to set up camera traps. These scrapes as well as urine spray marks were good signs of how frequently the snow leopards visit a particular location. On average, snow leopards visit this ridge once a month.

Zacharia, with Najin's other keepers, has had a front-row seat as the Biorescue Project works at @olpejeta conservancy in northern Kenya to restore this iconic species. \\n\\nDespite tremendous pressures on rhinos around the world, we have reason to celebrate. In September, the Biorescue Project announced the creation of five northern white rhino embryos, bringing the total to 22. This nourishes hope to produce offspring and give this keystone species a new future.

       "  'description': 'Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Happy World Animal Day! Jaguars have rebounded in the Brazilian Pantanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past, many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle, but jaguars may be worth far more alive than dead. In a paper published by the journal Global Ecology and Conservation, @pantheracats biologist Fernando Tortato found that a cow in the Pantanal is worth $2,000 in its lifetime, but a jaguar in this area brings in $108,000 each year in ecotourism income.\\n\\nThe Pantanal is a shining example of big-cat and other wildlife tourism as one of the most profitable land-use types on Earth. This is all the more important in world so fixated on beef production and agriculture that clear forests and release carbon into the atmosphere. Local people need to benefit from living with predators, not killing them and selling their parts. A sustainable future includes people living with wildlife and an intact healthy ecosystem. Think of all the people in an area that work in ecotourism—running the lodges, driving the boats, guiding the tourists—and the families their income supports. If you save the top predator in any ecosystem, you save everything under it.\\n\\nCheck out National Geographic’s campaign for nature at the link in bio, which advocates for the protection of 30% of Earth’s terrestrial land surface by 2030, and follow me @stevewinterphoto for more shots of big cats. #jaguar #jaguars #coexistence #wildlifephotography #beauty #pantanal #brazil #wilderness #wild #conservation #jungle #forest',\n",

Despite their reputation as scavengers, they are also efficient hunters, working alone to run down prey or together as a pack. The big cats that hyenas share the plains with—the lions, leopards, and cheetahs—rely on ambush and short bursts of speed.

       "  'description': \"Photo by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | This young pirate is Mikel, 3, in Bergen, Norway, photographed for my Toy Stories project. Wherever I travel in the world, I take portraits of children with their favorite toys. I've visited over 60 countries, where I've recorded the genuine joy that unites kids despite their diverse backgrounds. Whether the child owns a veritable fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride they have is moving, funny, and thought-provoking.

       "  'description': 'Photos and time-lapse video by Reuben Wu @itsreuben | As the full moon sets over the Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project near Tonopah, Nevada, thousands of billboard-size mirrors, called heliostats, begin their movements to track the rising sun and reflect its light at a central receiver. It heats molten salt, producing steam and generating electricity 24 hours a day. The heliostats move almost silently but for the sound of the wind howling through their structure. They look like a pixellated sea—for me, emblematic of how technology and digital media have become so pervasive in our lives and on our landscape.

       "  'description': \"Photo by @jasperdoest | A white stork searches for leftovers at a landfill in Portugal. Not too long ago, the white stork was a wholly migratory species that would breed on the European continent and migrate to Africa during the winter. However, since the 1980s, the year-round food supply at landfill sites like this one has resulted in the establishment of resident stork populations on the Iberian Peninsula. \\n \\nThe landfills have influenced the migration and facilitated the colonization of new areas. Now, with changes in EU waste legislation, open-air landfills are being replaced by facilities inaccessible to birds—which will again likely come with consequences for the storks' winter habitat, breeding, and migratory decisions.

These high-speed hunters pay an evolutionary price for their agility. Because they require large nasal passages to deliver the oxygen needed to power their impressive sprints, cheetahs are left with far less room in the skull to accommodate big teeth. Being light and lithe for maximum speed also makes them vulnerable to meal theft by larger predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas.

Like this frog, many other species in the Chocó rainforest are also threatened by habitat loss, mining, palm-oil plantations, and other causes.

During the Spanish colonial era, Indigenous Peruvians were enslaved as workers. The mine operated from 1566 to 1975. \\n\\nMauro de la Cruz is the leader of the campesino community near the Santa Barbara mine.

       "  'description': 'Photo by @jasperdoest | White storks gain altitude with the help of thermal winds. For this large bird, long-distance migration is partly dependent on gliding, which requires considerably less energy than having to flap its wings. The birds manage to do so by gliding on the warm thermal currents that rise over land, assisted by the prevailing winds. Thermal winds do not develop over large bodies of water, so sizable migratory birds such as storks and raptors are restricted mainly to land routes.\\n\\nI worked on a story about white storks, and soaring with the birds is certainly one of my all-time highlights. At one point, we had storks above and below us, a truly majestic feeling. Follow @jasperdoest for more images of the wonders of nature. #whitestork #birdmigration',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photos by @renan_ozturk | I\\'m on assignment with @m_synnott. We\\'re taking his Stevens 47 from Maine to Alaska via the Northwest Passage. We\\'re also working on a National Geographic story about the Franklin expedition that disappeared in the passage in the 1840s. Here\\'s an update (in Mark\\'s words). \\n\\nTaya, the yellow boat, was rafted up next to us. It come in the night before, the sound of metal crunching against rock as they motored over a shoal to reach a safe haven within this icy bay. The wind had finally died down and the sun was shining, so I decided to go ashore with a dinghy to stretch my legs. When I got back to the boat in the afternoon, chunks of ice were breaking apart all around us, sending mini tsunamis through the bay. The \"boulder\" where we sheltered for a day and a half now appeared ready to topple—and possibly crush the boats. There was nowhere to go, but we couldn\\'t stay. \\n\\nTaya set off first, and our boat, the Polar Sun, followed. At first we were only looking for a new spot to tie up. But after muscling past two huge floes, it became clear that we had to free ourselves from Pasley Bay. A light wind suddenly created small leads along the shore. Where there had been a glacial wall of ice the night before, we found an opening. And then another. And another.\\n\\nAt one point, the Polar Sun was so close to land I could have almost jumped off. Taya, which draws only three feet—meaning the depth of its lowest part in the water—was in front, radioing back the conditions. Two meters (six feet), the crew said. The Polar Sun draws six feet when it\\'s not massively overloaded. I throttled up. If we hit the bottom, we\\'d somehow just have to power through. Renan was up front calling directions. An hour later, the Polar Sun and Taya were in open water. But the ice was not done with us yet. According to the most recent ice chart, it was closing back up. Through the binoculars, I saw another wall of ice ahead... Until next time. @expedition.studios #OnAssignment @natgeointhefield',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photos by @renan_ozturk | I\\'m on assignment with @m_synnott. We\\'re taking his Stevens 47 from Maine to Alaska via the Northwest Passage. We\\'re also working on a National Geographic story about the Franklin expedition that disappeared in the passage in the 1840s. Here\\'s an update (in Mark\\'s words). \\n\\nTaya, the yellow boat, was rafted up next to us. It come in the night before, the sound of metal crunching against rock as they motored over a shoal to reach a safe haven within this icy bay. The wind had finally died down and the sun was shining, so I decided to go ashore with a dinghy to stretch my legs. When I got back to the boat in the afternoon, chunks of ice were breaking apart all around us, sending mini tsunamis through the bay. The \"boulder\" where we sheltered for a day and a half now appeared ready to topple—and possibly crush the boats. There was nowhere to go, but we couldn\\'t stay. \\n\\nTaya set off first, and our boat, the Polar Sun, followed. At first we were only looking for a new spot to tie up. But after muscling past two huge floes, it became clear that we had to free ourselves from Pasley Bay. A light wind suddenly created small leads along the shore. Where there had been a glacial wall of ice the night before, we found an opening. And then another. And another.\\n\\nAt one point, the Polar Sun was so close to land I could have almost jumped off. Taya, which draws only three feet—meaning the depth of its lowest part in the water—was in front, radioing back the conditions. Two meters (six feet), the crew said. The Polar Sun draws six feet when it\\'s not massively overloaded. I throttled up. If we hit the bottom, we\\'d somehow just have to power through. Renan was up front calling directions. An hour later, the Polar Sun and Taya were in open water. But the ice was not done with us yet. According to the most recent ice chart, it was closing back up. Through the binoculars, I saw another wall of ice ahead... Until next time. @expedition.studios #OnAssignment @natgeointhefield',\n",

But the disappearance of some animals in particular would take a profound toll on the health and balance of ecosystems. Keystone species such as lions and elephants play an outsize role in maintaining the delicate structure of ecosystems. When they decline, that structure begins to weaken and break apart. The good news is that protecting these animals has a similarly powerful but positive impact. When we invest in conservation initiatives that help lions and elephants thrive, entire ecosystems and a multitude of other species benefit. #lions #elephants #wildlife #biodiversity',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photos by @jimmychin | Travis Rice (@travisrice) is a mountain freeride snowboarder (and a filmmaker and designer) who\\'s hailed as one of the most renowned riders of the sport.\\n\\nTravis Rice is certainly one of the most creative athletes I’ve ever worked with. His eye for what is rideable down big mountains is second to none. He sees the mountain differently than everyone else in his sport. But it’s not just his ability as a big mountain (and park and pipe) snowboarder that makes him incredible—it\\'s also his meticulous attention to detail in terms of how snowboarding is captured. His instincts and sensibilities for filming  snowboarding is as visionary as his riding. \\n\\nIn 2016 Rice was riding in the backcountry of Alaska, film crew in tow, when the mountain’s snowpack \"spider-webbed\" around him, catapulting him into an avalanche. In his episode, he reflects on the near-fatal mistake that forced him into unknown territory and shares how the event has shaped his approach to big-mountain riding—and life.\\n\\nThe episode “Riding the Avalanche” premieres Tuesday, Sept. 13, at 10/9c. All episodes of \"Edge of the Unknown with Jimmy Chin\" are available now on Disney+.',\n",

Gabon is the second most forested country on Earth, forming part of the great Congo Basin rainforest that stretches across central Africa. In tropical rainforests, fog is produced from the temperature changes between day and night. As the rainforest warms, the water in the atmosphere evaporates and forms clouds—which generate rain the next day.\\n\\nWith its transpiration and evaporation processes, the tropical rainforest plays a key role in regulating Earth's water cycle. These rainforests help regulate rainfall throughout Africa, carrying water to the Blue Nile, which helps maintain the stability of the African continent.\\n\\nThis image was created during a licensed drone flight and was taken in accordance with local regulations.

       "  'description': 'Photo by @joshirwandi | Meet Nusantara, the new capital city of Indonesia. \\n \\nThis is an aerial view of the designated site, photographed in October 2021, on the island of Borneo. About 256,000 hectares (945 square miles) of a commercial forest will be developed, including 6,000 hectares reserved for a central government district. The new capital is projected to open in 2024, with the presidential palace among its first buildings. Construction is expected to continue up to 2045—which would coincide with Indonesia’s 100th anniversary of independence. \\n \\nOn the island of Java, the crowded current capital, in Jakarta, frequently battles flooding and rising seas. The city was built on a delta, with 40 percent below sea level. With Nusantara, Indonesia could start with a clean slate. Yet questions about how the megaproject will affect vegetation, wildlife, riparian areas, and the Native Paser Balik people remain to be answered.\\n \\nRead the full story at the link in bio.

       "  'description': 'Photo by Cristina Mittermeier @mitty | It’s hard to convey in words the kind of power Antarctica’s wild icescapes have over the human spirit. Drifting through the maze of glass palaces and towering icebergs is like stepping into a painting or a dream. The cold glow of the polar south’s light casts hazy shadows and paints the skies of dusk in swaths of crimson and indigo. Not only is it beautiful to behold, but it is also a critical sanctuary for an astounding array of life. Pods of Antarctic minke whales and seals roam the inky depths of the ocean. Penguins stream beyond the reach of the sun’s rays to chase clouds of krill, and high above, the mighty wingspan of the albatross commands the winds. But even amid what appears to be a flourishing ecosystem, the effects of climate change, overfishing, and pollution can be found eating away at its heart. If we are to succeed in reviving our seas, we must protect Antarctica—the icy heartbeat of our planet.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by @beverlyjoubert | It’s quite the exercise of the imagination to think about just how widespread lions were at one point in our planet’s ancient history. Rewind far enough and you can imagine them roaming far beyond their present-day territories—from the savannas and steppes of Central America to the plains of southeastern Europe. Today’s lions lay claim to a much-diminished kingdom, and even that is under increasing threat as development and habitat destruction fragment and encircle it. Without space—without protected wilderness—lions will continue to vanish. To safeguard a future for these magnificent predators, we need to make sure they have enough room to roam. #lions #bigcats #bigcatconservation',\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by @danwintersphoto | Today's scheduled launch of NASA's Artemis I test flight was scrubbed this morning due to a hydrogen leak in the fuel line. After multiple efforts were made to fix the leak during countdown, the launch was officially called off. The first attempt, scheduled for Monday, August 29, was also scrubbed, due to minor mechanical issues that could not be solved on the pad within the launch window. Weather also played a part on that day, as significant thunderstorms materialized in the area around @nasakennedy.\\n\\nAt approximately 4:45 p.m. EDT today NASA announced that the launch will be moved to a later date, possibly mid-October at the earliest—in order to make the repairs, the spacecraft will have to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building. In the meantime, the SLS rocket sits atop the pad at Launch Complex 39B. The goal of the initial uncrewed Artemis mission is to gather data on all spacecraft systems, leading the way for future crewed Artemis missions to the moon.

       "  'description': \"Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | I found these lions in late morning doing what lions do—lying there. The dark-maned brothers had most likely been patrolling all night. At the time, the light was not optimal for photography, and I knew they wouldn’t go far, so I would return later and dedicate the afternoon to following them. I imagined the picture: they would stretch, roll, and nuzzle each other for a bit, and then perhaps stand to send out contact roars to the females.\\n\\nAs I arrived, the sky began to swell, the clouds a welcome respite from the afternoon heat. I parked for a view of the mound, with composition in mind. I watched as the aerial masterpiece continued. But the lions did not move. Rays of sun exploded through billowing cracks. The lions rolled over. The sun found a circular hole in the sky cover, and the termite mound exploded in a beam of gold. The lions did not move. I would wait until they got up. I was ready with a wide-angle lens. They never got up. \\n\\nThe sun met the horizon. The afterglow continued into a crescendo. The lions lay flat. Perhaps they knew what I'd come for and laughed at my confidence, or they wanted to test my resolve. Or, just maybe, they wanted me to look beyond them and remember the larger picture we are all a part of. #lions #bigcats #wildlife #lionking\",\n",

This little island in the middle of the Arabian Sea has been a trading post since the Greeks first described the world—and has since been touched by most civilizations. The red resin of these trees—the liquid called dragon's blood—was harvested and traded in ancient times, and it still is today. An icon of Socotra, the tree is also a national symbol for Yemen—it even graces the 20 rial coins of the country's currency.

Each group is slightly different in their social structures and language. Pod members spend their lives following in the wake of their wise matriarch, hanging on to her every instruction in order to hunt and navigate the seas. The matriarch is usually the oldest female that learned everything she needs to lead her family from her mother and grandmother. It’s this intergenerational wisdom that allows orcas to thrive in all kinds of marine environments around the world, passing on traditional knowledge much in the same way we pass our own culture and skills to our children. It’s deeply humbling to know we share our planet with such extraordinary animals that, as it turns out, are not so different from us.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photos by @joshirwandi | Jakarta is one of the world’s fastest sinking cities, with estimated land subsidence reaching up to 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) each year. But flooding and land subsidence affect no one more immediately than the residents of North Jakarta. To mitigate the problem, the government of Jakarta has been developing the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD) plan, also known as the Giant Sea Wall project, since 2014. The walls will take the shape of the garuda–Indonesia’s national bird—and are predicted to cost as much as 40 billion U.S. dollars. The first 8-mile phase of the proposed 29 miles has been done.\\n\\nPhoto 1: Seawalls in Cilincing, a fishing village in North Jakarta, where the Rawa Malang River flows into Jakarta Bay. The area floods constantly during the rainy season.\\n\\nPhoto 2: Fishermen carry fish in crates in the port of Muara Angke, North Jakarta, one of the most rapidly subsiding and frequently flooded parts of the city. Fishers here worry that the government’s coastal walls will limit their access to the open sea, the source of their livelihood.\\n\\nPhoto 3: The Waladuna Mosque in Muara Baru, North Jakarta, has been affected by coastal floods since 2000. The mosque is no longer used. \\n\\nWil the proposed Giant Sea Wall project save Jakarta? Click the link in bio.

       "  'description': 'Photos by @jimmychin | Legendary climber Conrad Anker has been pushing the limits of mountaineering for the past 30 years, evolving into one of the best alpinists in history. Based in Bozeman, Montana, he’s one of the most prolific explorers alive today. He’s equally at home in Antarctica, in the Himalaya, or on his home ice in Hyalite Canyon.\\n\\n@conradanker has been my friend, mentor, and climbing partner for more than 20 years. I owe much of my life trajectory as a climber, photographer, and filmmaker to him. Conrad gave me a chance to come shoot with him when I first began making pictures, and it was my launching pad as a photographer. He paved the way for me to join the North Face Athletes team, of which I’ve been a member for over two decades, and he invited me on my first National Geographic expedition, where I learned how to film. We have been all over the world together, and he’s been my climbing partner on my most significant climbs.\\n\\nIn his episode of “Edge of the Unknown With Jimmy Chin,” Conrad faces one of his most difficult moments of survival in the mountains. After suffering a heart attack while hanging 20,000 feet (6,100m) from the side of Lunag Ri, then the tallest unclimbed Himalayan peak, he and his climbing partner, the late David Lama, have to fight their way back to Base Camp. Conrad is one of the toughest people I know, and self-rescuing from this Himalayan first ascent certainly proved the point. He recounts his astonishing experience and explains how his heart attack and age have modulated his risk threshold.\\n\\nRenowned mountaineer and professional climber Conrad Anker’s episode, “Return to Life,” premieres Tuesday, Sept. 6, at 10:30/9:30c.\\n\\n“Edge of the Unknown With Jimmy Chin” premieres Monday, Sept. 5, at 9:30/8:30c on National Geographic, and all episodes will be available on Disney+ on Wednesday, Sept. 7.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by Dan Winters @danwintersphoto | The 322-foot-tall Artemis I Orion spacecraft sits in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida, just prior to rolling out to the pad. Its uncrewed launch was planned to take place August 29 at KSC's Launch Complex 39B, used 53 years ago to launch Apollo 10. However, due to an engine issue on the rocket, the launch has been postponed. NASA is evaluating the problem to see if they can try again as soon as September 2. Once launched, it will circle the moon on a roughly 40-day mission. Artemis I, the most powerful rocket ever built, delivers 8.8 million pounds of thrust and will ultimately serve as the vehicle that will once again deliver astronauts to the moon. \\n\\nFollow me @danwintersphoto for continuing coverage. @nasa @nasaartemis @nasakennedy @nasajohnson @nasa_michoud @nasa_marshall #nasa #artemis #kennedyspacecenter\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by Cristina Mittermeier @mitty | I watched him carve a deep wake through the snow as he lumbered across Svalbard’s winter wonderland. Then suddenly he paused to lift his snout and looked curiously toward the shore at our little zodiac. We were about 200 feet (60 m) away from him, but he still managed to catch our scent. Eventually, he turned his attention back to his path until he became completely indistinguishable from the snowscape. Polar bears are powerful, incredibly beautiful animals, and I’ve had the immense privilege of photographing quite a few over my career. Their habitat in the Arctic is undergoing drastic changes, but I know if we act today, we can protect the future of these bears forever. #winterwonderland #svalbard',\n",

It's designed to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion power. Fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars: when light atomic nuclei fuse together to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released. Fusion research is aimed at developing a safe, abundant, and environmentally responsible energy source. Seen here, the oval-shaped superconducting magnets (center, between the white pillars) are among the largest components of the ITER machine. Read the full story at the link in bio.

Later in the day, we were lucky to record a second rocket launch from SpaceX.\\n \\nI was given the opportunity to capture life from behind the scenes at Walt Disney World Resort. Stay tuned in the coming weeks and months for more about what makes Disney possible. The Walt Disney Company is majority owner of National Geographic Partners. @WaltDisneyWorld @starwars @natgeointhefield #DisneyWorld50\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | When most people think about a safari in Africa, they think of a trip during high season, usually the months of June through October, which, of course, is hands-down incredible. Indeed, sightings are epic. The land is dusty, hot, and brown. The tall grasses are gone. And since the animals must come to drink, a water hole is a perfect place to be positioned at.\\n\\nBut there is another magical time for an African safari, one that many never consider. Rainy season not only is a less expensive time to visit but also offers a completely different landscape—one of technicolor green backgrounds, flowers, and golden light. Sure, dense foliage and thick grasses sometimes pose a bit of a challenge spotting predators. But when you do find them, the images to be made are of a completely different level of awesome.\\n\\nI had no trouble finding furries on this trip to Botswana. And I didn’t just find the predators—I found their baby versions. Two different families of leopard cubs and their mothers, and two different families of lion cubs and lionesses, graced the days. Botswana unveiled scene after scene of photographic opportunity, from African wild dogs to big cats to hippos, elephants, and rhinos. I think the rainy season is my new favorite time to visit. \\n\\nFor more stories of animals, follow me @kaigner. #babyanimals #bigcats #babies #lioncubs #lions #africa #travel #botswana',\n",

This photograph would not have been possible without their support. I’m looking forward to sharing more photographs from this important story, so stay tuned! \\n\\nRead the full story at the link in bio.

       "  'description': 'Photo by Cristina Mittermeier @mitty | Torrents of cardinalfish raced past my lens to avoid a Galápagos sea lion overhead. Even as I lifted my camera to frame the pinniped gliding against the surface, I had to fight to keep myself in place. The current yanked me back toward the reef, and high above I could hear the hiss of a powerful wave striking the rocks. Dizzy from the effort of keeping steady and swarmed by living streams of fish, I managed to squeeze the shutter just in time to make the image. With Ecuador’s announcement last year to expand the Galápagos, I cannot wait to see this stronghold of marine life truly flourishing. What kind of world could we have if we not only restore our ocean but also help it thrive like never before? Diving here makes me believe in a better future—one beyond our wildest imagination. #galapagos #sealion #biodiversity',\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by @estherhorvath | Maria Josefa Verdugo from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute holds an ice core taken in the central Arctic Ocean. Scientists drill ice cores to measure the concentration of greenhouse gases, in order to learn how much methane is broken down in the Arctic Ocean and how much of the gas ultimately reaches the atmosphere. As a photographer, I'm interested in the scientists who deliver such critical climate data to us and how they live and work in one of the harshest environments on our planet. Working in thin gloves in -35° temperatures is hard on the hands. You have to constantly monitor yourself and other members of the expedition for frostbite on hands and faces. Please follow @estherhorvath and @awiexpedition for more polar stories.\",\n",

Far across the water, I could just make out a pair of brown bears crossing between the misty banks—pausing here and there to inspect the currents for salmon. I knew that just beyond the towering canopies of wise, old conifers, the sweeping wilderness inevitably met urban life marked by winding roads and sleepy towns. But here in the mountains, animals like bears seem almost tiny. I took this photo as a reminder that there is space for all the wild creatures we share our planet with, as long as we leave our forests and rivers intact.

Leopards are among the many predators that wait along the route, well aware that the passing herds offer a not-to-be-missed opportunity for sustenance.

ITER—designed to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion power—will be the world's largest reactor. Nuclear fusion is the power source of the sun and the stars. When light atomic nuclei fuse together to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released.

In fact, they spend most of their time just hanging out. It’s easy to interpret this as laziness, but it’s actually very smart. If you live in a prey-rich environment, it pays to stay still and let the food come to you. There’s an added bonus: Because you’re still and quiet, you have the element of surprise. This is, of course, assuming you can wake up in time! I’m always staggered by a lion’s ability to go from fast asleep to full hunt mode in seconds. Photographed with special drone permissions for my new show coming later this year to @disneyplus. #EpicAdventuresWithBertieGregory',\n",

The megadrought is requiring the seven states along this key lifeline to make drastic cuts in an effort to conserve four million acre-feet of water for next year, about one-third of the river's annual flow.\\n\\nMost of those steep cuts will need to come from agriculture and the lower basin states, which use more water than they are allocated. I’ve documented the Colorado from source to sea over the course of a decade, and I'm still amazed that we ran the river dry—it no longer reaches the sea—and that few realize how precious and scarce this lifeline is.

On this cold, gray, and snowy day, a family of orcas swam purposefully across a fjord, and I watched them for a while, curious about their destination. Quietly slipping into the sea, I saw this scene, and it struck me as a mourning procession, a family in grief. Possessing high levels of cognition, orcas, and whales in general, live complex lives that we are only just beginning to understand.',\n",

But little by little the seeds, now literal and figurative, took root, as the hands on the garden that would evolve into a farm multiplied. On November 2, 2008—the afternoon he was baptized—Covington made the farm official, inviting loved ones to a celebratory dinner and asking them to serve as board members.\\n\\n“It’s somewhat spiritual, for me,” he says. “It’s like a sanctuary.

In the northeast: the community and education center, farm, and zoo. Further down the street are a youth house and garlic beds. And in the northwest: houses that Covington hopes will one day be restored for anyone in need. \\n\\nIn this collection of images, the greenhouses, gardens, and animals of Georgia Street Community Collective are shared with residents of the neighborhood.

       "  'description': 'Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | Out here, we don’t get to choose. As the light on the wild landscape turns perfect, the  thorn tree log, long fallen, with deep, dark lines and a gnarled character, would make the ideal frame for a spotted cat. But there isn’t one around. The bare termite mound stands against a looming stormy sky laced with sunset accents—seemingly begging for a perfectly maned male lion to appear. But the landscape is empty and epic. We know the animals are here—their travel stories are written in the sand, their tracks cross ours not long after we’ve driven by. We want to see them. We get anxious. We have come over oceans. We have spent money and time to lay eyes on that which the travel books promise. \\n\\nBut the bush does not exist to appease our human demands and desires. It keeps us acutely aware of our small place in the wild world, teaching us patience and mindfulness. But there is always a moment, the space between our desires and acceptance, when nature chooses to unveil what we seek. \\n\\nThe leopard and her daughter spent two hours here, allowing us a window to their world. As the sun began its departure, they rose, melting into the bushes. We drove to the other side, hoping for more time. And there they were, wrapped in each other and the light, more than we ever could have hoped for. Africa, you never disappoint. #leopard #bigcats #babyanimals #cats #catsofIG',\n",

While we were there, we documented an international team of researchers—led by Nele Meckler from the University of Bergen, in Norway—aiming to reconstruct a tropical climate from far back in time.

In their epic search for abundant grazing, the million-plus wildebeest represent a vital force in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. It’s up to us to protect this iconic spectacle from threats such as climate change and uncontrolled development.\\n#wildebeest #GreatMigration\",\n",

Even as they sank a little further into the plush sand with each lapping wave, they stood firmly planted on the shores of their ancestors. Facing the future takes incredible courage, especially for our younger generations. The planet is changing; fishnets are turning up empty, plastic is choking out wildlife, and natural disasters are becoming the norm. And yet, looking at these three girls with their boards clutched to their sides, I feel hope. The future will be won through courageous action taken every day as we look toward a better tomorrow.

For most of that time, stories were recorded as images drawn on the landscape. Some of those stories still survive. As part of an @insidenatgeo grant, I 3D-modeled rock art sites in the American West. The size and complexity of the artwork is daunting. At over 80 feet (25m) long, this panel is longer than two city buses and rivals the size of Diego Rivera’s murals. The deer with the spiral tail gets most of the attention, but there are so many details—scores of quadrupeds and anthropomorphic figures are represented in this composition. Follow me @salvarezphoto and the nonprofit @ancientartarchive for more.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by Keith Ladzinski @ladzinski | I captured this detail of a pangolin's scales, covered in the rich red sand of the Kalahari Desert, as it foraged for termites. Pangolins are generally nocturnal, preferring to hunt when conditions are cooler and under the cover of darkness. They're also one of the most illegally trafficked animals on Earth due to their keratin scales, used in traditional Chinese medicine; they're made of the same protein as a rhino horn or a human fingernail. Law enforcement seizures of pangolin scales and meat reached an all-time high in 2019. Worldwide, more than 128 tons were intercepted—an increase of more than 200 percent from five years earlier.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by @johnstanmeyer | Feeling tired after a ceremony for the village's ancestral spirits, Dominikus Weu, a mystic known as a Musaluki Puu, takes a rest among wafting incense, in the village of Woloara on the Indonesian island of Flores. For a story on volcano mysticism, I spent two days with Dominikus and his fellow shamans, who live near the top of Mount Kelimutu, an ancient, sacred volcano. I recall how Dominikus described his culture's connection to my favorite number, 7—how only seven shamans at one time are granted their powers, selected through an elaborate hand and finger counting process only found within the Lio tribe of Flores. Sometimes I wonder whether he's still alive and if he passed on his knowledge to others—the sacred rituals and healings through nature that, once we forget, are lost forever.

       "  'description': \"Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | Today, July 16, is World Snake Day, so let's pay tribute to their key role in ecosystems everywhere. I've photographed snakes on all continents where they're found, producing two stories for @natgeo in the process. It's tough to single out a favorite species, but the Jameson's mamba, photographed in the rainforest of Cameroon, is a strong contender. Its venom is lethal; unlike other venomous snakes that specialize in just one kind of venom, the Jameson's mamba delivers a particularly nasty cocktail: hemotoxins, cardiotoxins, fasciculins, as well as myotoxic substances. The lethal characteristics of snake venom are what make it so valuable; scientists study the genetic and molecular makeup by collecting venom and DNA samples. This has led to the development of medicines for heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Also, this does not affect the wild populations since all snakes are released after a quick field sampling.

After breakfast, we loaded our backpacks and headed toward the snowy peaks in the distance, en route for a 15-day trek. For the past 22 years, some of my best memories have been crafted in these mountains, pathfinding with a heavy load and a free heart. Swipe to see my five-year-old build a makeshift tent after crossing a nearly three-mile (5 km) glaciated pass close to the border of Afghanistan.

It’s not just the void that would be left if their irreplaceable ecological role were to go unfulfilled. It’s also just how much poorer our natural world would be in their absence. Their extraordinary intelligence, their memory, their deep sense of family and empathy, their ability to behave and communicate with each other in so many complex ways—elephants enrich our world in ways that we are only beginning to understand and appreciate. Keeping them here is up to us.\\n\\n#elephants #elephantconservation #wildlife',\n",

The project Home Pharma is the result of my curiosity. Some people are understandably reluctant; others are proud to open their doors. The medicines often can reveal who the people are: Their desires, wants, diseases. It’s very intimate. What do our medicines say about us?\\n\\nFrom the left, Wholl-Lima Balthazan, 56, her mother, Silemoieux Charikable, 76, and her son Lozèma Astrel, 20, are seen in their house in Port au Prince, Haiti. Wholl-Lima works as a secretary for a Haitian cultural organization. She uses traditional Haitian medicine to cure herself and her loved ones—mainly using leaves that can be found in local markets or provided by a \"leaf doctor.\" Follow me @gabrielegalimbertiphoto for more photos and stories. #pills #pharma \\n#bigpharma #health #medicine #pharmacy',\n",

Scientists are studying plants and trees, including lodgepole pines in the area, to determine how forest ecosystems respond after wildfires. When lodgepole pines are burned, their serotinous cones open up and drop to the ground to seed the forest— but if another fire comes before trees mature, they may not grow back. This image was captured while photographing an assignment for the May 2022 issue of National Geographic.

As a result, predators have also largely disappeared. But the return of vegetation and grazing mammals will, it’s hoped, culminate in the reintroduction of the critically endangered Arabian leopard, once the top predator in this vast and mysterious land. Overall, the aim is to restore Saudi’s landscapes to their natural state. Engagement with local communities is vital if this is to succeed. Here, the local village elders released the first wildlife back into this ecosystem, where for almost a generation it had been absent. Today, if you sit on a rock in the desert and look around at the rugged crags, the canyons, and flat sands, you won\\'t see any wildlife, but you can see the potential for what could be here once again. To see more follow me @chancellordavid.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by @amivitale | Giraffe browse in the Singita Grumeti Reserves, a conservatory adjacent to Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. The male giraffe (left) has a snare around his neck. Snares are traps, most often made of wire, set by poachers to catch animals for the illegal bushmeat trade. While many animals caught in snares are consumed for food, others will be left to rot or be so severely wounded that they cannot feed or hunt, drying as a result.\\n\\nAcross Africa, giraffe populations dropped nearly 40 percent in three decades, a decline thought to be linked to habitat loss and fragmentation as well as poaching, including animals killed by snares. But  giraffe numbers may be rebounding. An analysis of survey data from across the continent suggests the total giraffe population is now around 117,000, approximately 20 percent higher than in 2015, when the last major survey was published. The increase can be attributed to population growth in some areas but also to more accurate census methods.

He grew up in a neighborhood where everybody loved music and used it as a form of self-expression. “We was running around with radios in our hand, walking up and down the block,” he says. “Didn’t have nowhere to go. And that became our medicine of life.”\\n\\nReflecting on his career and the moment he realized people identified him as a legend, Raekwon says, “It hit me a long time ago that people really love what I’ve done and what my crew done. But I look at it as a thank you note that made people be like, Yo, you could do it. So to the people giving me that love was like a thank you note to myself.”\\n\\nOne of the roles music plays in Black culture is helping listeners “get away from the stresses and imperfections in our circumstances,” Raekwon says. “You listen to music, and it just does something to you. It’s almost like music becomes a vitamin inside your mind.”\\n\\nMusic brings both happiness and joy to the world. On Black joy, Raekwon says, “It’s freedom and having a great spiritual vibe inside of you. It’s feeling like you made it. It’s paying respect to our ancestors.”\\n\\nThis weekend, National Geographic is capturing Black joy through personal stories and behind-the-scenes moments at the ESSENCE Festival.',\n",

Let's see if people receive us.” Questlove thought it would be something fun to do, not knowing the path they would forge that day. “[It] goes to show that when you're living in your heart and with integrity, doors open,” he says. \\n\\nTheir legacy motivates and inspires them to continue making music, and today they incorporate education and history into their performances. “Even tonight on stage—going through everything from Dixieland to soul music—we have to incorporate everything, like the entire history of Black music, in our set,” Questlove says. “It's not just about The Roots doing our stuff. We have to represent a whole culture when we go on stage, and that's why we do it.” \\n\\nReflecting on Black joy, Black Thought says, “Because of the days and times that we live in, it’s a form of rebellion, so it's that we celebrate our Blackness in the way that we do and that we embrace it, and that's what we put out there into the world. It makes us disruptors. It makes us rebels, in a sense, but that’s what it is. What the ESSENCE Festival represents traditionally is just the deepest level of that Black joy. It’s people celebrating their Blackness and celebrating Black families and legacy, and it's a beautiful thing.” \\n\\nThis weekend, National Geographic is capturing Black joy through personal stories and behind-the-scenes moments at the ESSENCE Festival.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo by @jasperdoest | A few years ago, a doctoral-student friend in Uganda texted me about villagers working together at night to trap what were actually swarms of bush crickets, which become tasty, protein-filled snacks when salted and fried. I was transfixed by the greenish glow in the photos she texted: a light that people use to attract flocks of insects before dawn. Unfortunately, overharvesting and climate change could threaten this food of the future, and villagers have seen a rapid decrease in the numbers of bush crickets.\\n\\nTo get the story right, I had to rely on the community. I withheld judgment on the practice and pointed out the economic and nutritional importance of the insect. I came to watch, experience, learn, and connect, as I believe it is through mutual understanding that we can find solutions.\\n\\nFollow me @jasperdoest for more on the relationship between humankind and nature. #nsenene #uganda #crickets #grasshoppers',\n",

The largest body left this 180-meter-wide crater (600 ft). Slide 2 is a video from inside one of the craters during early morning, with ambient bird sounds. The site of the Henbury craters in the Northern Territory was indeed one of the darkest places on Earth that I\\'ve observed in many years of night photography. The nearest town is Alice Springs, about 140 kilometers (85 mi) away, and the only \"light dome\" visible was a gentle glow from the south, which soon turned out to be the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy visible to the unaided eye. The southern Milky Way was most spectacular when the galactic center reached high in the sky. The foreground is lit by a few side flashes during the 30-second exposure. #twanight #meteorite #australia #impactcrater',\n",

Photographer Pat Kane captured this image for a story about the fur industry and how Indigenous trappers in northern Canada are affected—economically and culturally—as falling fur prices, rising costs, and antifur sentiment threaten a centuries-old way of life. Kane, who is of mixed Irish-Canadian-Anishinaabe ancestry, lives in the traditional homeland of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. \\n\\n“Reminds me of home,” says Quannah Rose Chasinghorse. “The warmth and comfort of a log cabin, and going outside to the cold and enjoying the beauty of the open sky and northern lights.”\\n\\nTo celebrate National Geographic's July cover story, model and activist Quannah Rose Chasinghorse is taking over the @natgeo Instagram account.

       "  'description': 'Photo by @davidemonteleonestudio | Professor Thomas Brück takes a sample from the pond at the “algae center” in Ottobrunn, Germany. He and other researchers at the Technical University of Munich are working with Airbus to study how algae might be used to create biofuels at the 1,500-square-foot (more than 16,000 sq ft) site, whose façade is made of special transparent glass that lets ultraviolet light pass through. Via elaborate climate technology and LED lighting, researchers can simulate climate and lighting conditions of any location on Earth to stimulate algal growth cycles. Algae functions as a net carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, so converting them to fuel creates a sustainable energy cycle.

       "  'description': 'Photos by @andrea_frazzetta | The Appian Way is the most famous Roman road still in existence. At roughly 360 miles (580 kilometers), the route connects Rome to Brindisi. It was one of Europe’s first highway systems and inspired the phrase \"All roads lead to Rome.\"\\nThe Appia has been a feature in daily life for Italians since its construction in 312 B.C. In fact, Italians still refer to the route with reverence as Regina Viarum—the Queen of Roads. But its legacy has been largely neglected, and its stones buried under millennia of history. Now a government project is under way to transform the Appia into a pilgrimage crossing from Rome to the sea on the heel of Italy’s boot: to bring thousands of visitors strolling across the wide, flat basalt stones.\\nFor the full story on this Roman-era \"superhighway\"—written by @ninastrochlic—visit the link in bio.\\nFollow me @andrea_frazzetta for more images from this project. \\n#Italy #appianway #Roma #lastrada',\n",

       "  'description': 'Photos by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | Twenty years ago, I was walking across America, from Encinitas, California, to New York City—3,349 miles (5,389 km) in 154 days. I had no cell phone and no support crew. Just me, my dog, Cosmo, a camera, and a wagon filled with supplies. It was the project that started my photography career.\\n\\nOn the walk, I went to prom, won second place in a hog-calling contest, ran out of water in the desert, slept in an open jail cell, got blisters three layers deep, almost got hit by more trucks than I can count, loitered a lot, and got really good at playing a children’s electric guitar.\\n\\nThe first thousand miles were marked by extreme physical pain, as I whittled my untrained body and mind into shape. I kept thinking that the place I needed to be was somewhere other than the present moment, step, or conversation. Over time, this desire to be anywhere but in the present broke away.\\n\\nThe middle 1,500 miles was a space of opening like I’ve never experienced in my life—a time marked by letting go of everything. The pain went away, and all the doors seemed to open as I walked ten 30-mile days in a row out of Santa Fe, feeling unstoppable on the road.\\n\\nWith 900 miles left, I stopped in Bloomington, Indiana, and rested for three days. I sat down with a map and charted what I believed would be the end of the walk. When I saw that end on the map, it felt like it was over. I already knew I could do it; I’d already done it. That last 900 miles started to hurt again as I looked too far ahead. I had to make each day about the people I met and go deeper into those conversations.\\n\\nEventually I arrived in NYC, where friends met me at Battery Park, playing \"Riders on the Storm.\" It felt incredibly anticlimactic, because there was no \"there,” no grand finish line. The end of the walk didn’t feel like the end at all, and so the walk just keeps going ...still. To learn more and read journal entries from that time, follow @argonautphoto.',\n",

Male lions have a reputation of being lazy, as they often rely on females to hunt; less known, however, is that they scavenge a lot of their food from hyenas—very efficient hunters. Male lions rarely hold prides alone; they usually form bonds, often with related males, to work together to protect the groups of females and their cubs within their territory.\",\n",

Prompted by food shortages and congested fishing areas, fishers developed the practice during World War II as they adapted to a changing environment. \\n\\nAt least half of Earth’s oxygen comes from organisms in the ocean. That’s right—more than half of the oxygen you breathe comes from marine plants, such as phytoplankton and seaweed, that engage in photosynthesis. That is, they use carbon dioxide, water, and energy from the sun to make food for themselves, releasing oxygen in the process. In other words, they photosynthesize. And they do it in the ocean. Think about that for a moment. It means at least every second breath each one of us takes comes from our beautiful oceans. Today, take a deep breath and feel that connection. We need to protect them, so we can breathe! \\n\\nSupport an ocean organization near you, or learn more from some of these inspirational ocean advocates: @oceanswellorg @localoceanco @dr.sylviaearle @brianskerry @Sealegacy. #oceans #srilanka #fishing',\n",

During the pandemic, Guðmundsdóttir had cherished the extra time she had with her two teenage daughters and decided to have another child. “I think that was the tipping point for me,” she says. “I realized I wasn’t ready to be done with the mom thing.”\\n\\nWith a staggering 16.5 percent increase in births during the second quarter of 2021, Iceland has been in the midst of a pandemic baby boom. A leading hypothesis on why this might be is that in times of economic uncertainty, the Nordic country’s generous family-leave pay helps alleviate concerns about increased financial burden. A new baby can be a safety net.\\n\\nAll five Nordic countries offer paid parental leave for at least 11 months, based on income from the previous year. Payouts range from about 53 percent income in Denmark to nearly 100 percent—and as much as $6,000 a month—in Norway. In Iceland new parents receive 12 months paid leave at 80 percent income, up to about $4,500 a month.',\n",

Processing this image in black-and-white, I was inspired by the tones of some of the early prints of Yosemite Valley by the great Carleton Watkins. To see more from my travels near and far follow me @stephenwilkes. #olympicnationalpark #pacificnorthwest #blackandwhite #natgeo',\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by @johnstanmeyer | In Jordan, I walked through this windswept valley, Wadi Hafeer, with Salmeh. We chatted, Salmeh in broken English, me in ruinous Arabic, mostly listening to the silence and the bleats of his goats. Petroglyphs were carved here 8,000 years earlier. Our ancestors began to walk through this valley (wadi) some 60,000 years ago. In many ways, we are hardly different from when we started that human migration from lands further south, in what today we call the Horn of Africa. Our primary distinction is the borders we've created since, dividing us. As we neared his encampment of his Bedouin family, Salmeh's wife called out. He stopped briefly to listen, but the moving herd was too loud. At that moment in this natural cathedral, as the sun spread near-shadowless light inside the ravine and worn hills, I felt timeless along the highway of our human existence.

But in almost every respect, it is the lionesses who come into their own amid the rough-and-tumble of the hunting battle. Stealthier, faster, and lithe on their feet, the females of the pride are the real stars here … and success so often hinges on their skills, experience, and carefully coordinated maneuverings. #lions #bigcats #bigcatsofinstagram',\n",

Rolls-Royce is one of the biggest suppliers of civil turbofans in the world, so there’s a good chance you've flown on a plane powered by one of them. On the company’s production line, every single detail in the construction of an engine is double-checked by machines—and humans. Many pieces are, in fact, manually assembled.\\n\\nHere, a massive Trent 1000 development engine is being moved from the prep shop to Testbed 80, where the piece will be tested and inspected.

       "  'description': \"Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | The snow leopard evolved to live in the high-elevation desert of India's Himalayan range, and every part of its body shows signs of these unique adaptations. The nose has its own story. Large nostrils and a broad nasal cavity make it easier to inhale large amounts of oxygen-poor mountain air. The nasal cavity houses particularly large and thick mazes of bone and tissue called turbinates. When a snow leopard inhales freezing air into the turbinates, it gets heated as it mixes with warm air exiting the lungs. Now that's an incredible life hack that evolution has provided to these big cats. Follow me @prasen.yadav for more photos from India.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Photo and video by Corey Arnold @arni_coraldo | Believe it or not, this large brown bear is actually a male American black bear that has settled into an abandoned home in South Lake Tahoe, California. For my new feature in National Geographic magazine’s July issue, I followed urban ecologists and wildlife experts across the United States in search of bears, raccoons, and coyotes that have uniquely adapted to life in dense urban settings. This bear slept under this home most days, and like clockwork every night after dark, he would balloon out of the crawl space and scour the neighborhood for unattended garbage.

       "  'description': 'Photo by @timlaman | Here is a creature that really deserves its name: the flamboyant cuttlefish. I photographed this small cuttlefish—it was only about an inch (2.5 cm) long—on a night dive off the coast of West Papua, Indonesia. As with many boldly colored critters such as caterpillars or nudibranchs, this cuttlefish is highly poisonous and advertises its toxicity with a bright pattern. One of the things I like the most about exploring the marine realm is the otherworldly life that call it home. I encountered this cuttlefish toward the end of the dive. I spent as much time as I could photographing it but eventually had to surface because I was running out of air. I’ve never seen another one since. Follow me @timlaman as I celebrate the incredible biodiversity of our planet. #cuttlefish #underwater #coralreefs #indonesia #westpapua',\n",

Both women carry medicinal plants, used throughout the region for healing. During the pandemic, midwives in Chiapas have been on the birthing front lines, especially in remote areas, despite receiving little support from local health-care authorities. As COVID-19 spread throughout the region, women began to fear hospital safety even more than before. As a result, Girón Pérez’s workload spiked, and she started handling two to three births a day. Girón Pérez attended 346 births in 2020, 403 in 2021, and more than 125 so far this year in the two-room birthing space she and her husband built beside their home. Her dream is to expand this area to include a private waiting room and kitchen for families who need lodging.

I often return to the Swahili term and Kwanzaa principle of Kujichagulia (Self-Determination) and its focus on building identity both as a person and as a community, both historically and in the present day. It raises the question “Who am I?” I am made of my ancestors, my past and present moments, my community, and my neighborhood. Chronicling Black life for future generations, the intention for this project, meant not only visualizing the tenderness in my family’s gatherings but also utilizing the universal language of photography to record moments of rest, leisure, and joy in Black women and girl’s traditions at home and in play.\\n\\nOn this Juneteenth, National Geographic is highlighting Black creators who have chronicled the experiences that nourish their communities.

This young male—tracked via a radio collar fitted by the team at the Cook County Urban Coyote Research Project, led by Dr. Stanley Gehrt—found his way to a small green strip near downtown and settled with a mate in one of the few areas not already claimed by existing packs. (That’s the former Sears Tower in the background!) After the first flash of lights from the camera trap, the coyotes were wary to walk by again. I left this camera set up for four months before finally getting this shot, but sadly after this photo was made, the coyote was found dead, apparently hit by a car. Life in the big city for urban coyotes is often short-lived.

The module will provide electricity, water, and oxygen as well as temperature and course controls. This third ESM is at the start of its integration phase where equipment, brackets, and harnesses will be added to the structure. An uncrewed Artemis I lunar mission is planned for early summer; the crewed Artemis III mission planned for 2025 will see the first woman and next man setting foot on the moon.

But @Renan_ozturk and I are also #OnAssignment for @natgeo to re-trace the Franklin expedition, which disappeared in the Northwest Passage in the late 1840s.\\n\\nStay tuned for future reports. For now we're heading into the Gulf of Maine en route to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Follow @renan_ozturk for more photos from the field. #ThePolarSunExpedition #Sailing\",\n",

Ny-Ålesund is a science community of researchers who conduct climate studies year-round and support staff who make living and working there possible. Ida planned to stay in Ny-Ålesund for a year to experience everything the place had to offer, but she has stayed almost two years now and doesn’t want to leave anytime soon. In addition to her duties as an electrician, Ida is also part of the watch team that responds to accidents, fire alarms, even polar bears in town.

This phenomenon occurs when colder, nutrient-rich water from the depths is lifted closer to the surface by winds, replacing warmer, depleted water. Upwelling peaks in spring and summer along the California Current with the seasonal intensity of northwesterly winds. To see more of this beautiful part of the planet, please visit @ladzinski.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | In central Spain, a species known as a little owl feeds on a katydid at sunrise, when the spring and summer temperatures are still low and the owls are more active. Little owls feed primarily on insects like beetles and grasshoppers as well as bigger prey such as rodents, reptiles, and amphibians. They're one of the best allies for farmers, helping to keep pests under control. Unfortunately the use of insecticides has decimated the populations of many species, including little owls. The lack of prey and nesting sites are other threats, mainly due to the rise of industrialized agriculture.

Moonlight was softly shining on this otherworldly landscape, creating enough light to reveal details with just a 10-second exposure. Orion the Hunter, rising high in the sky, seemed to lead a troop of bentonite beings. The largest formations in the view are 10 feet (3 meters) tall. I have photographed numerous natural landmarks at night, and those in Nevada’s Cathedral Gorge State Park have made for some remarkable memories. The eroded soft clay is the exposed bed of an ancient lake. // This is Nevada—awe-inspiring, otherworldly, and gloriously unspoiled.

This particular evening a clearing storm left both valley fog and the Milky Way visible from the Cherohala Skyway. The Skyway runs through the Unicoi Mountains, and when a storm clears those mountains the view is phenomenal. Experiencing sights like this leaves me filled with wonder at the beauty of the world. // This National Get Outdoors Day, @visitnc and experience firsts that turn into moments you'll never forget.

The population on Mendol is small. Very small. Google \"Mendol Island,\" and you\\'ll discover the only mention is a rice mill, with a photograph of a shed that looks to be from the \\'40s or \\'50s. It\\'s as if Mendol doesn\\'t exist. I was told to visit the pool hall in Teluk Dalam. That afternoon I spent a few hours in this hall, as milky-green light poured in on the few tables, occupied continuously with serious players. Instead of enduring another disgraceful loss (I enjoy billiards, but I\\'m terrible at it), I drank coffee and talked to men who were laborers on nearby islands or farm their land. Everyone was kind—the beauty of Indonesian culture—and extremely welcoming. There was an energy of desperation, though, as if everyone was waiting to go somewhere else, to do something more. To see more of my work, please follow @johnstanmeyer. #indonesia #riau #mendol #island #billiards #pool #poolhall #billiardhall',\n",

While researching the subject for a National Geographic article, I spoke with anthropologists, shamans, and local Balinese journalists, including my friend and assistant Tilik Wayan, whose father was a bit of a mystic himself. I learned about the temple on Mount Agung, in Bali’s Besakih village. The Balinese believe that spirits reside in this volcano.\\n\\nDuring a Melasti (purification) ceremony on Petitenget Beach, participants turn their backs to Agung—the most sacred active volcano on Bali—and enter into a trance. Some press with all their might a sharp dagger into their chests (sometimes their heads). Having lived in Bali for more than five years, I've witnessed many trances involving daggers and never saw anyone puncture skin. It’s considered a blessing to go so deep into a trance, a level of spirituality not to be feared.

       "  'description': 'Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Watching elephants go about their lumbering business as the sun dips beneath the horizon, you may begin to wonder: When and how do these iconic giants sleep? The truth is that the pachyderm life leaves little time for snoozing. In the wild, it takes almost constant foraging to keep those supersized bodies fed with a plant-based diet—as much as 300 kilograms (660 lb) daily for a large adult. And then there’s the vigilance required when you live side by side with large predators; they may have few natural enemies, but caution is still critical. All of this means most elephants sleep for only a couple of hours at a time, and entirely sleepless days and nights are not uncommon. What’s more, unlike us humans, elephants pay little heed to sunset and sunrise when deciding on bedtime. #elephants #elephantsofinstagram #wildlife',\n",
